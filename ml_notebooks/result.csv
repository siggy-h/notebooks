"my stay at this hotel was one of the best i have ever had! the location, service and accommodations were all outstanding!! the lobby area is beautiful as was my room. in the room there was more than enough space, which is difficult to find in chicago hotels. my only gripe was the room was a little dark. sure, staying at a small, upper-class hotel like the talbott involves paying a premium but it was well worth it. the service was timely and everyone seemed friendly and informed. the room service took a bit longer than i would have liked, however, the food was good quality. another nice touch was the gym pass provided for guests at the equinox fitness center. finally, the location is perfect!! it's located in a beautiful area of the city near the gold coast, which has many very good restaurants. a personal favorite of mine is mario's, a nice italian place nearby. overall, my experience at the hotel was good and while it had some minor flaws they were, for the most part, insignificant.

"i have to say that the hard rock hotel in chicago is a cool place to stay. when i first got there, getting checked in was very fast. the lady at the counter was nice and well spoken. the bellhop had out bags into the room very fast. the room was very hip and cool. there was musical items all over the place. i really loved the beatles art that was in my bathroom. after being in the room a few minutes, i got a call from the front desk asking me if i liked my room. they also asked me if i would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if i needed to use their business room. i needed some things shipped while i was there, which they had supplies to help me with that. after getting some work done, i called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around. they gave me information for 3 awesome places. i left and came back after having a night out on the town. they were very understanding that i was a wee bit out of it. i had more than pizza that night if you get my drift. when i got back to my room, the bed was so comfortable. i feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep. in the morning i order breakfast, which was really a philly cheese steak. they will make anything you want anytime of day. i checked out by 9am with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed. thank you hard rock, you rock!

"my husband and i recently stayed at the hard rock hotel chicago and we can't wait to go back! the hotel is located in downtown chicago and seems to be at the heart of the city, we were close to everything. the hard rock hotel is forty stories high and the view from our room was simply breathtaking. the room itself was spotless and featured modern luxurious decor and furnishings. the bed was heavenly. the hotel staff was friendly, upbeat and extremely helpful, we asked for directions and restaurant recommendations and they were spot on with both. i highly recommend the hard rock hotel in chicago and i would stay there again in a heartbeat.

"upon arriving to the hard rock hotel in chicago, i was immediately impressed. the staff was friendly and checked us in quickly, which is important to me after a long trip. our room was immaculate and decorated in a clean modern style. the bed was very comfortable, including the linens which felt high quality, unlike what you get at some other hotels. all this made for a great night sleep. perhaps the most impressive part of our stay at the hard rock hotel was their ""party like a rottweiler"" package we added to our reservation. for an additional fee we were able to bring our pet and were provided with treats, toys and best of all the pet cam! we left our dog in the room with a pet cam and were able to watch him throughout the day on my iphone! all in all this was a great place to stay and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to travel with their pet.

"i just came back from this awesome, terrific hotel last week, and i have to say-- i loved it! my wife and i were there for a week due to a business meeting, and right when i stepped into the hotel, i knew that this business vacation will be well spent. the customer service was very great, and an employee even guided us toward our room! we were introduced to a fantastically lit room with 2 beds, a flat screen tv, and even free internet access. my wife loved it, and kept on using the free shampoo and body bath soap. when i headed down to the lobby for my conference, i got lost, and asked one of the people who worked there where my meeting might be held. he leaded me to the door, and i was very impressed. there is a fitness center which i went everyday, and this great restaurant called c-house situated nicely next to the hotel lobby, where i had a nice steak and my wife a salad. all in all, i thought that the trip was really worth it, and my stay was very welcoming at the affinia chicago. i highly recommend that whenever you visit chicago you should stay there, you will not regret it.

"i first walk into the beautifully decorated lobby of the affinia chicago hotel where i'm greeted by name by the concierge. he tells me that they have taken the liberty of customizing the room to my profile from when i booked the stay. he shows me to my room (paying careful attention to my bags, and ensuring that i needn't lift a finger) sure enough, the down pillow i had selcted from the dream pillow menu sits proudly atop the queen of the domain, which by the way is covered with the softest of bedspreads making me wonder if they didn't literally drag a cloud in here and fit it on my bed. i notice that there's a display of champagne and cupcakes (!) atop the dresser and my ""experience kit"" which comes complete with an ipod shuffle downloaded with only my favorite workout tracks, and a yoga mat. namaste. unable to resist the urge to inspect the bathroom, i find that not only is there a marble tiled invisible glass shower, but a jacuzzi, lined with candles of vanilla, deep enough to bathe a walrus. feeling girlish, i run the water and test before going to dinner. the hotel's restraunt c-house offers the most delicious seafood menu that makes you think you're dining with the kings of paradise. or at least eating in the caribbean itself. hmm, i should have brought a date.

"i have to thank the ambassador east hotel for providing a really great experience for my family. we never leave our dog at home when we travel, and it's been a long time since we've been able to find a place of this caliber that allows pets. the staff even spent time cooing over how cute our dog is when we asked about local clothing boutiques. my husband liked the fitness room. it was nice and clean, with plenty of extra towels available. it was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water, but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves. we will definitely be staying here next time we visit chicago. we would make the trip just to stay here. that's how welcome we felt when we stayed at this hotel.

"the ambassador east hotel, located in downtown chicago, is one of the best hotels i've ever stayed in. my wife and i went into the city on a weekend getaway and found the ambassador east on a hotel booking website. their rates are very, very reasonable for the high class and luxury that they provide. i was pleased to know that they allow pets as we decided to go into the city last minute and couldn't find anyone to watch our dog for the weekend. i was more than pleased with the friendly staff and felt like their hotel put an extra emphasis on knowing their customer, which is nice because most places in chicago are very impersonal. all in all i was very pleased with our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown area. 5/5 stars.

" the hard rock hotel chicago is great alternative to ordinary hotels. the hotel is decorated with a huge variety of music memorabilia that makes the stay worth it alone. the hotel is often visited by many talented artists including singers, dancers,actors etc. the staff were very polite and helpful and always pleasant. the rooms were very clean and nicely decorated, as were the common areas and hallways. i would highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in the area.

"the talbott hotel is fantastic! i stayed there on business and found that it met my every need. the high speed internet access worked flawlessly; allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room. i really like to exercise before a day of meetings; access to the fitness club next door was very convenient. last point: i work for a green consulting firm out of l.a. and the hotel's environmental credentials dovetailed perfectly with our mission. guilt free luxury!

"my husband and i decided to plan a romantic get-away for our one year anniversary when we stumbled upon the talbott hotel in chicago. we decided to book the ""personally yours romance package"" for our stay. when we arrived at the hotel, the staff was very friendly and approachable. the personalized key cards we received upon check-in were a wonderful touch. each night, we would return to our suite to find the linens turned down and rose petals scattered across the bed. the personal concierge even helped me plan a special outing for my husband and i to see a chicago cubs baseball game. i would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a weekend away.

"i enjoyed my stay at the talbott hotel. it is on the more expensive side, but it is all worth it. i got the talbott tradition package, which was $245 for two people and included a $30 breakfast credit on check out day. the rooms are huge! the beds are soft and comfortable. they include aveda bath products, which is a plus in my book. they also have a nice fitness area & pool you can use while you stay there. one thing i thought was really cool is that you can forward your messages from your hotel room phone to your cell phone. my boyfriend also liked the ihome audio system. the location of this hotel is very convenient as well, its close to several great restaurants and blocks from the coast. but, what i like best about this hotel is that they make an honest effort to not negatively impact the environment more than they need to. they were one of the first hotels to be green sealed. overall i had a great stay at talbott hotel!

"i traveled to chicago recently with my giant german shepard dog rex and picked the hard rock hotel for the perfect location and because a close friend had warmly recommended their pet friendliness. the service truly is incredible. they even had a web-cam so i could check in on rex while i was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when i could not make it home from a meeting the day after. the rooms really rock (pardon the pun). nothing like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets. the easy chair looked so good that i was almost afraid rex would snack on it while i was out, but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better. i would definitely recommend the hard rock hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets.

"the affinia hotel in chicago was superb. the room service was exemplary and the food, i don't even know were to start. the chef obviously knew what he was doing, i especially loved the seafood, my personal favorite was the shrimp. aside from this, i loved how beautiful the hotel was. it is definetly a bargain for the price, for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but, i felt as if i was in a $10,000 a night 5 star hotel in the europe. great bang for your buck. would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city. my friends actually went their a while back because of me. they loved it! i know you will too.

"set up an important meeting for some clients at the hard rock hotel chicago. they were flying to chicago for a special trip to checkout the music scene and to discuss business with my company. naturally, they wanted to stay here. the client really seemed to like their rooms, but felt the paul reed smith room was too cramped for our day-long meeting (330 sq ft.). in a panic, i contacted the hrh staff and they actually had another, bigger, room available. we quickly moved our meeting in the birdland room for the rest of the day and the meeting was a rousing success.

"the rates at the talbott hotel were cheaper than i had expected, and that was my reason for booking a room. i had been prepared for service and a room similar to what i had experienced in the past, and i was quite pleased when i did stay. the room was neat and clean, and the halls were quiet at night. the traffic noise was muffled to the point where it was no problem sleeping either. i did ask one question at the service desk and they answered it nicely, which is good because normally hotel workers can be a bit snippy, especially at night. overall i had no problems with the talbott hotel and i would stay at this here again if i were in the area a second time.

"the intercontinental chicago is conveniently located near midway airport so the commute was short and easy. the room had a great view of a lake. room service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great i did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee. there was a business center that had internet, fax machines, and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day. one of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs, it was exactly what i needed, very relaxing. the food at the eno was some of the best i ever ate especially the chocolate, i never wanted to leave. this was a great hotel experience and i would stay there again.

"at the intercontinental chicago, you pay for more than a room. you pay for an experience. let me elaborate. i was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. like any novice traveller to chicago, i saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs, and those were originally what i set my sights on. price is a powerful signal, and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. but after doing a bit of research, i realised that distance does have its costs. the price of transit in the chicagoland area isn't free. and it's far from what i'm used to. car use is price prohibitive. (i knew that originally, which is why i wasn't going to drive.) but the sting of using the automobile (parking, congestion, toll roads, etc.) gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. so, i ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. but mass transit has its costs too, which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. that's what originally drew me to intercontinental. but intercontinental is much more than the right room at the right place. the decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. i was travelling on international business, so the ease with which i could transact in foreign currency was a draw. (they had a currency exchange right there on the premises.) and the fact that massages, dry cleaning, and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. my work gets me tied up in knots. it also leaves little time for doing chores. so the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. but, on top of all that, the event planning was what put intercontinental over the top. being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders--and something i won't forget. in the end, if you're a newcomer to chicago staying in a time-crunch, the intercontinental is for you. the pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive, but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs, it's nothing in the end. and the intercontinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options, it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be.

"i never thought i'd be able to stay at a hotel and feel completely at home. i am a mother of two children, one of which has severe asthma and allergies. i have spent more time in hospital emergency rooms than my own living room for the past two and a half years. so when my sister was getting married in chicago, i was extremely anxious. the front desk associate, rosa, was wonderful. she told me that they have allergy friendly rooms. no perfumes, no harsh cleaning chemicals, no dreaded ""industry standard"" feather pillows. i booked a room, but was still really worried. i shouldn't have been. ethan breathed as easily in that beautiful room as he did in our own home. maybe even a little better. they had an air purification system for our room. it smelled so fresh! while my husband took our daughter to the big bar for nachos (she never stopped talking about how ""totally cool"" it was), i ordered room service for my son. the man who answered the phone was so patient and accommodating. my son has a lot of food allergies, so i was pretty much ordering off menu with specific details. that's always a little humbling, but the staff treated my order with the grace as though they did special orders all the time. i was actually able to enjoy my sister's wedding. the only problem with my stay is that it was too short. we're coming back for our first family vacation since ethan was born. thank you, hyatt regency chicago, for making this family's visit possible and positive!!

"we recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park while travelling for business. what an incredible experience! friends had stayed there years ago, but when we showed them our photos, they couldn't believe the amazing renovations. while we loved the modern decor and style, our main reason for choosing this hotel was because of what they call fairmont pure rooms. i have had so many awful allergy attacks while travelling, so i wasn't too optimistic that they could actually make a truly hypoallergenic and allergy-free room. i have to say i felt great during our entire stay. we enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine and incredible cheese and appetizers at eno. what a treat to get such amazing food and wine without even having to walk out of the hotel. this hotel is truly beautiful, everything you would expect from a high-end, big city hotel. our stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park didn't disappoint us in any respect. our only disappointment? we don't have a reason to go back to chicago anytime soon, but i have a feeling we will be making reservations for another visit in the very near future.

"my wife and i checked in to this hotel after a rough flight from los angeles. we decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel while visiting our recently graduated son, and we were not disappointed. the location could not have been better, as we were afforded easy access to chicago's culture and shopping by being just off michigan avenue. after a long day of exploring the city, we enjoyed a fantastic dinner on the terrace overlooking the city. the halibut was cooked just right, and our waiter made us feel very welcome with some friendly conversation. overall, i would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in chicago!

"the omni chicago hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel, particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv's. the windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room, before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows, which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom. an in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay. there's even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince. however, the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use, as well as the whirlpool, jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool. sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks. a nice aspect that isn't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel. the omni chicago is a great way to add a bit of luxury to any type of vacation, particularly when you don't want to be separated from your pet, within the area.

"i recently stayed at the hotel monaco and i must say, it has become one of my favorite hotels in the windy city. in the past, i've always stayed at the marriott or the hilton so this time i thought i'd go with a boutique hotel. i've stayed at some of the kimpton properties in san francisco so i was delighted that they are running the monaco. basically, i like the friendly, real-people atmosphere as opposed to the corporate style places i've used before. i do work out and they had a decent fitness center with the treadmill i normally use. south water kitchen served a terrific meal even in a city of great restaurants. i really dug the complimentary coffee, high speed internet and newspaper. i get tired of being nickel and dimed by the corporate hotels and liked the fact that the monaco offered a bunch of freebies -- especially liked the afternoon wine service. all in all, i will return to the monaco. it's a great alternative.

"my wife and i recently stayed at this hotel for a fun anniversary weekend away from the kids. upon check in we were pleasantly surprised by the decor, the location to so many downtown attractions and the attentiveness of the staff. as a seasoned traveler for business i consider myself somewhat savvy when it comes to service and accommodations. this hotel certainly delivers on both accounts. my wife and i had not intended on eating in the hotel restaurant, but after reviewing the menu we thought we would give it a try. wow! service was outstanding and the food was amazing. we truly enjoyed our dining experience. all in all i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone i meet.

"the sofitel water tower was a wonderful place to stay for my husband and me for our 20th anniversary weekend trip to chicago. we got married in the city but then moved away, and it was so romantic to return. we loved how near the sofitel was to everything - the magnificent mile was just outside our door, and we could walk to navy pier and other attractions as well. chicago has changed, but the sofitel made it feel like home again... except a very plush and elegant version of home! we stayed in a junior suite, which had great views of the city, and room service was very attentive when we called for champagne after midnight the day we arrived. both nights before leaving for supper, we had a cocktail in le bar and enjoyed talking about what we'd done during the day, and all the great memories this town has for us. but i have to say we have some new great memories now, thanks to the sofitel water tower!

"the hard rock hotel chicago has become my favorite hotel. i've stayed there at least 5 times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience. as you might have guessed - it has a super rock & roll theme, with some music paraphanelia in the lobby and on each floor's elevator lobby. the rooms all have large photo murals that are themed to different musicians. you can request being on the floor of your favorite band (like kiss, aerosmith, etc...) the rooms are great. well appointed. super comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and wonderous pillows. the large tv has a cool sound system that ramps up the viewing experience. there's a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar. i've always had a room with big windows and a view down michigan ave (the hotel sits right on michigan - a block from the canal). the bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures sporting a great design... some of the showers have windows in side of them (you can shower and enjoy the view down michigan!) or close the waterproof drapes. i've never had anything but a great experience with the staff here... front desk, doorman, etc are all great. there's a lobby bar that still feels intimate and has nice energy. big screen tv to catch the latest scores, too. of course, rock & roll music pumps thru the place. you can stay at a ""plain"" hotel anywhere... but this is a great, well designed, fun and memorable hotel that you'll want to return back to. if i had one concern - it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight. my daily car parking rate was close to $50 per night, which i'm sorry to say is about the going rate in the loop. stay here. be cool.

"we stayed here because of all the great reviews, and it's all true. we were highly impressed with the high quality of everything, everyone, and the location. walking distance to much of what chicago has to offer. gibson's steakhouse and the hancock building to name a couple. this hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for chicago. it should also have more than three stars. i mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard, and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those. depending on the room you get, any price under $250 would be a good deal. between 250 - 300 could still be worth it.

"just returned from a 3 night stay at the talbott. this was our first visit there, and i can honestly say that i wouldn't stay at any other hotel in chicago. from when we first were greated by the bell captain until our final departure, the staff was nothing less than amazing, always greeting with a smile and can i help you attitute. the room we had (1508) was very spacious and comfortable. the bed was probably the most comfortable that my wife and i have ever slept in (including the four seasons). had great breakfasts and drinks at basil's. you would be missing a fantastic experience, if you didn't stay at the talbott.

"wow!! where do i start? booked this hotel through hotels.com for less than i paid for the travellodge downtown. check in was a breeze, the entire staff was friendly and helpful. our room was huge. the king bed was very comfortable. our room also had 2 nightstands, 2 chairs with a small table, a desk, and walk-in closet. even with all the furniture, the room was very spacious. the room did show some signs of wear, but i think this adds to the charm and the rich history of this hotel. the hotel is located in a neighborhood, so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel. there is very little noise, however, you are only about 2 blocks from rush and division streets, with all the nightlife, and the red line at clark and division is only 3 blocks away. we decided to walk to michigan ave and the next thing we knew, we were at the hancock building. by staying here, you are away from the noise, but not away from the action. had breakfast at the pump room, which is a story in itself. we had our photo taken in booth 1. take some time and research who has sat in this booth. it is impressive. some 1400 photos of celebrity guests adorn the walls of the pump room. didn't have a chance to have dinner here, but i will return for dinner someday. breakfast was not anything fancy, and a bit pricy, but the history and experience was worth it in my opinion. the waitstaff was friendly as was everyone who worked at this hotel was. i can't wait to return here!

"the hard rock hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into chicago.. the location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as lake michigan, millennium park, and art museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from. my co-works loved the exterior of the building, views from the rooms, the art on the walls, and crisp, clean & hip feeling of the hotel, but not ""too over the top"" for ""business"". by far a better experience than your usual ""chain"" hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms. here you feel special...for the same price. the lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on michigan ave (or catch a real rock star in the lobby!)

"my husband attended a conference in chicago for the weekend of june 22nd and i decided to tag along for the shopping! we flew into o'hare and took a cab to the hotel, cost about $30. everybody from the doorman to reception desk to concierge were extremely friendly and helpful. we had a room on the 9th floor which overlooked the construction, but we were hardly in the room so it didn't bother us. we were also never awakened due to construction noise and my husband is a very light sleeper. the room was clean and spacious enough for us. the bed is very comfy. we ate in the restaurant downstairs several times for breakfast and lunch and all meals were great. the location of this hotel is perfect. you are about 1&1/2 blocks from michigan ave and the hancock tower. can't beat that! there is also an adorable pet store called tails in the city across from the hotel! i brought our dog back a couple of toys! they are very nice as well. all in all, no complaints. the hotel is clean and beyond what we were expecting. the staff is always friendly and the location is superb. it's a safe neighborhood-i walked around by myself and felt fine. we would definitely return.

"as we pulled away in a taxi heading to the airport for our trip home my wife turned to me and said ""we picked the right place."" having chosen the talbott from other trip advisor reviews i found myself thinking in terms of a trip advisor review when we arrived. nice entrance, friendly reception, i noticed everything and immediately knew the talbott was a non-corporate warm hotel with touches not typically seen in big name hotel chains. the smell of the elevator and attention to decorative details strongly reminded me of europe, simple, not overstated but elegant. the location is great, there was light snow but we walked to the art institute, rush street, the theater district, and we're from california where anything below 50 degrees keeps us inside! all i can say is if you are the kind of traveler that wants comfort, class and somewhere unique, stay at the talbott. oh yeah, we were in a room that looked down at the construction, we were on the 15th floor and could not hear a sound, it was very quiet.

"we booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on hotwire over labor day weekend. we arrived at the hard rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. hooray! we were on the 5th floor (beatles theme). the rooms were very comfortable. one of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. the other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, the bathroom was full of aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. the tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't in the room a lot to use it. we were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged. no problems there. we did not make use of the free fitness center, because the weather was perfect. my husband was able to go for a run through grant park along the waterfront instead. he said it was wonderful. we did use the free internet in our rooms. it was 'wired' internet, but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. the room was a bit dim at night, but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. there was virtually no hall / elevator noise. the location of the hard rock is ideal. it is easy to get breakfast at the corner bakery, just blocks to either grant park, the art institute, state street shopping, or michigan ave. to sum up, there was absolutely nothing to complain about. we would be glad to stay here again any time.

"very quaint and romantic, yet masculine. i've noticed that at most chicago hotel bars it's hard to get a drink much less a seat but i guess because it's a small hotel that was not a problem at the talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that! would love to stay again but i must say that i was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too firm. also note there is no gym on the premises - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout!

"we also just returned from a frigid weekend in chicago. i booked the ambassador east because of its great rate, $89.00 with my aaa card and we were delighted. yes, the rooms show some signs of wear, but the warmth and charm far make up for it. this was such a pleasant change from the sleek, modern look of many other chain and boutique hotels. we became members of the i preferred program and were therefore eligible for an upgrade which we automatically got upon check in. we had a lovely suite with lots of sitting room and a comfortable bedroom and bathroom. we had wonderful food at the pump room which is classic. our oatmeal there was so tastefully served, i'd love to have some right now! the location was great. had it been normal winter weather, we could have easily walked to michigan avenue for shopping, but due to the minus 20 degree windchills, we opted for a cab which was less than a $5.00 fare. we also enjoyed a glass of wine around the fireplace in the lobby and found it so welcoming and cozy and not overcrowed at all. we would definitely stay here again!

"this is a stylish hotel located right on north michigan avenue, a five minute walk from the orange ""loop"" line that will get you to and from midway airport. forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft, we were told). decorated in grays and white, the room was comfortable and soothing, not jarring. on the other hand, we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading, finding keys, etc. no kidding. the bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. on the positive side, however, there were aveda products in the bathroom, the windows were huge, so during the day there was tons of natural light, and no issues with darkness. the king size bed was very firm, but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. we had a largish tv with a dvd player. there is a safe and munchies. the gym is perfect, equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. it is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. there are towels, water, headphones, disposable ear pads, and complimentary green apples. suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd, take the elevator up to 22nd, then down to l2 to get to the gym. this way you dont have to traverse the lobby. the front desk staff is amiable, and very attentive. i read some other reviews about nasty personnel, but did not have that experience at all. i got a free newspaper with a smile, a free stamp when i needed it, change and all the coffee i could tolerate in the morning. the hard rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the water tower, the drury theater, john hancock, and magnificent mile. for those who like a thrifty breakfast, we recommend gourmet pantry at 155 n. michigan avenue [--]. this deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a sunday morning, no less: $1.99. the hotel has a breakfast buffet for $15.00 per person, but we did not partake of it. we would stay at the hard rock again, and think it is great for people with ""tweens."" not sure about the toddler set, though.

(think of the hotel from the shining, minus the elevator of blood and creepy twins.) from the check-in desk to the surprise turn down service from the maids, i was made to feel like royalty. a special acknowledgment goes out to the doormen who helped me with all my tourist questions. also the location of the hotel is great. close to all the action, but on a quite residential street with beautiful old mansions. i also got a sweet $89 per night room by booking on travelzoo. that was just an added bonus however. even if i paid $200 per night, my impression of the ambassador would not change. highly, highly recommended.

"my wife and i stayed at the ambassador east hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-october. we decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of chicago in a week. i'll start out by saying that this was a great experience. at check-in, i indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite. the ambassador east is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the north end of the magnificent mile. it is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on rush. our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed. our suite (on the 3rd floor) had two very large closets, a large ""living room"" and a large bedroom. the bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough. if i would have payed full price for this suite, i probably would have given it a rating of 4, but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and i had such a great time here, i decided to give it a five. it is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful. my wife and i decided to eat at the pump room restaurant, but we were not very impressed. we found the food and service mediocre. the atmosphere was probably pretty neat when sinatra used to eat there back in the day, but not anymore. although we were unimpressed by the pump room, the staff were kind enough to seat us in the ""sinatra booth"" which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains. that neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here. the ambassador east is an older hotel, but it is in a charming older neighborhood. the staff's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me. when we are in chicago again, we will definitely consider staying at the ambassador east again.

"after reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo, i decided to give this hotel a try. i must say it was a great choice! the location is perfect, just off from n michigan ave, walking distance from everything. the staff was very helpful and friendly, and the room was excellent. they gave us a corner room w/a great view. as many have posted, the bed & pillows were very comfortable (i am very picky about that). i slept well every night! the renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit. i highly recommend this hotel.

"stayed at the chicago affinia dec 10 thru dec 12 and was very impressed with the staff, the room, and the location. close to shopping and the pizza place next door was great. of course, there were many other restaraunts nearby as well. i had a little trouble figuring out the heat, but it was fine once i learned how to set it. they were working on the hotel, so we got a great rate. but the work never bothered us. the room was great, with the walk-in shower in the spacious bathroom a wonderful surprise. i would definately stay here again and would recommend to others.

"have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted. great bar (draught stella and guinness) which was being upgraded at the end of march when i was last there, good food, lovely staff, large clean rooms, comfortable beds, spot on location for the golden mile, joey's pizzas next door are fantastic. ignore any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please. highly recommended

"booked a room online and got a great rate under $200 which is very cheap for a summer hotel room in chicago in this nice location, 3 blocks i think from the water. even though our rate was so cheap, the service was wonderful, the front desk were polite& cheerful, the doormen and valet were great and helpful, and they even put a fridge in our room when we requested on, free of charge! the fitness room was clean, large and provided fruit and clean towels, and it had the greatest view of the city as it was on the top floor of the hotel. location of hotel is safe, and such a beautiful area. check the rates directly online of the hotel's website, as it was the least expensive. we will stay here again for sure.

"we stayed at the ae for two nights for a three generation ""girls weekend"" (grandma, mom and daughter). i looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us. then i called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named reece. rates were a bit high for the saturday night portion of our stay but when i requested the american girl package, he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate. the american girl package was perfect for us. my 8 year old daughter was thrilled. they give you a doll bed, a backpack and a travel kit to keep. they have matching bathrobes for girl and doll (you don't get to keep those). she also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu. our room, 1334, was large and clean. it had two double beds with nice linens, two chairs, a desk and a clean bathroom. the employees are all very friendly and helpful. we had a drink in the pump room but did not eat there. we ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd coast. this hotel is north of michigan ave. but it is just a short, pleasant walk to the mag. mile. i would definately stay here again in chicago.

"the ambassador east is located in the gold coast neighborhood of chicago. it is just a few blocks from the train station, so it was easy to get anywhere in town. the hotel is a national historic landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful. we loved the pump room bar with tons of b & w photos of celebrities. the service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful.

"recently returned from a two-night stay at ambassador east hotel. was looking for a comfortable hotel to stay at while visiting family now located in chicago. mission was accomplished. if you would like a quiet, comfortable hotel in a great area - this is it. while some of the furnishings show some signs of their age, it does not detract from the elegant style of the rooms and adds to the comfortable and home-like feeling. found staff to be friendly and helpful. we will be return guests many times in the future for sure.

"i was attending a conference at the mariott. they were booked up and i shared a room at the hard rock for a week by default. what a lucky break. this is a beautiful hotel. i am not a fan of all that black/grey vibe and find it a little cheesy. what i loved was the way the hard rock left the beautiful old hotel features intact, and decorated around the basic stucture. my room was clean, clean, clean. i want to comment on the staff. what an upbeat group of people. this included the doormen, the front desk, the consierge. they were wonderful! every morning one of the bell men would find my tv morning news show for me in the bar, while i drank their courtesy coffee. they brought us a refrigerator, ipod dock, and extra suitcase stand within minutes of check-in. i had a hard time contacting the airport transport. the consierge took care of it for me. while i was waiting for the 4:50 am airport shuttle, one of the bell men found me a cup of coffee in the back. i just couldn't get over how nice and friendly everyone was....great place to stay. i hope to go back with my husband.

"we live down the block from the hotel. we arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away. the floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night. i think the ambassador east was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there. over the years i had had some visiting groups stay there. i had also eaten there and been to the bar but i had never stayed there myself. the lobby is elegant. the service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated. the location is the best residential area in the city (as far as i am concerned -- i live two blocks away) and it is very convenient to north michigan avenue ( a good shopping street) and reasonably convenient to the loop ( the main business area) there are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city. i paid less than $100 including tax for one night. i am not sure what their regular rates are but i think my deal was the best travel bargain around.

"this hotel cannot be beat for location, price, & atmosphere. the location is ideal, at the corner of state & kinzie. there are fantastic restaurants & bars all around, including house of blues & harry caray's. we stayed in a ""corner king"" room. the room was amazing. two of the four walls are floor to ceiling windows. even just being on the 5th floor, we had great views of the surrounding area. the decor and amenities are unmatched. the decor is very clean & simple but luxurious. the hotel is easy to miss from street level, but shouldn't be. the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. its a perfect home base if your plans revolve around river north, state street shopping, or clark street nightlife. even if you'll be on the mag mile, this is a short cab ride away. we've officially named this our downtown hotel of choice!

"the allegro in downtown chicago is a great stay/ part of the kimpton group boutique hotels the allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price/ they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city. i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the 'el' into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the hotel/ otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors,comfortable beds and in my case great views. if you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days / kimpton does a great job and their properties are ""class acts""

"the hotel is beautiful. it is an excellent location. there was a few minor issues. the hotel is clearly geared toward the convention and business crowd. there were charges for almost everything, although i did not incur any of these. our room was a little small for the class of hotel, but not overwhelmingly small. not a true complaint, but the elevators were very slow. my comparison was that we stayed in an equally aged hotel in a different city during our trip, and the intercontinental's were significantly slower. that's it, no more little nit picks. the staff was excellent, the doormen being the highlight. the hotel bar was also very nice. the hotel was immaculately clean. i would definitely travel to this hotel again.

"just spent three nights at the amalfi hotel, while in chicago on business. booked a king-corner room and loved it. largest room i've ever had in a hotel in chicago, incredibly comfortable, very clean. the breakfast and evening cocktails were a nice bonus too. and the location couldn't be beat. walking distance to the the river, the loop, michigan ave shopping and convenient to public transportation. i noticed a number of reviews commented on the noise; yes there is some street noise, and the building across the street is under construction (the noise from that was usually between 730-4, if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side) but really, in downtown chicago it's not going to be silent, if you want silence stay in the suburbs. if you want a great hotel (at a great price) right in the thick of everything, stay at the amalfi.

"my wife and i had to stay downtown for event that we were attending at the drake hotel. i have stayed at the drake before and while it is nice, it is bit stuffy and a little outdated for the price. we opted to walk across the street and stay at the millenium instead. i know this property has under gone many renovations in past year and i have to say they have done a great job. this place used to be the hotel you would crash in when you came to chicago on a college roadtrip (i did). but that is not the case any more. this property is directly across from the drake hotel and for 1/2 the price you get their great location with a newer (albeit smaller) room and every ammenity you would expect from a 4* hotel. the rooms are tastefully decorated (asian influence w/flat screen tv) and the bed is very comfortable. the bath is small (no tub), but very clean and the shower is great. you are not going to be spending a bunch of time in your room when visting chicago, so the room's size is not a big deal. (it works well with a couple, but a family of four may be a bit cramped.) the service was attentive and friendly and the location can't be beat. i would definitely stay here again, but the next time i would leave the car at home ($49/night parking is a bit steep).

"we stayed at the swissotel for a special birthday weekend for my wife from aug 25 to 29. i had called ahead to ask for a nice room and to order flowers for my wife. jaymes ballard, the concierge, made arrange for flowers, early check-in and we had a great room. our room was the 33rd floor with a view facing the city. room was large, everything looked like new, great bed, large bathroom with separate shower, great ammenities. a beautiful bouquet of flowers arrived upon our arrival. the hotel is about 10 mins from everything, not close but not far from anything. has a great restaurant, 2 patios outside where i had a cigar. a really nice pool and hot tub on the 42nd floor. i would recommend this hotel to anyone and thanks to jaymes for making our trip very special.

"we absolutely loved the knickerbocker. now, if you expect your hotels to be cookie cutter comfortable, forget this place. if holiday inns are like the rows of housing developments in the suburbs, the knickerbocker is like those beautiful old houses in the center of the city. the location is great, the hotel bar is cozy and classy, and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in victorian mansions. for the price, you simply can't do any better than this in downtown chicago.

"my first trip back to chicago in about 7 years was perfect! i chose the knickerbocker as i had read that their rooms were recently renovated on top of being a great location to michigan avenue, rush street and downtown chicago. i must say i was very impressed with the guestrooms! i had not stayed there prior but it definitely is a refresh from what i've seen in photo's posted on the reviews. the guestrooms are nicely decorated with a modern feel and they are good sized for a historical hotel! the beds are wonderful -- i need to get a pillow top mattress at home! i used the internet access with no issue and i loved the larger screen tv's. the shower is fun with the different types of shower heads you can choose. and the bathrooms are fresh with all new granite and tile. i'm anxious to get back to chicago and it won't be 7 years from now! i would highly recommend this hotel -- fantastic guestrooms, location and staff! i've added some digital pictures of my room as they are completely different from the one's i saw on previous reviews with the new renovation.

"i booked this via priceline, and was not sure i'd like it, as some sheratons have fallen off the cliff. this hotel absolutely surpassed my expectations. despite booking with priceline, i was treated like a king. they let me check in early, gave me a beautiful room, and even went so far as to look up my starwood number so i could get some credit for the stay. the staff was unfailingly pleasant, the property immaculate, and the room very comfortable. i highly recommend this hotel.

"ok, we are back from the knickerbocker and i would give it the best rating. i can't believe the bad reviews. i got a priceline deal, and i still got a fine room, clean, up-to-date furnishings (ok a little traditional for my taste) and smoke free. someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews. i think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth. here it is from my point of view. both rooms on 10th floor. regarding the size of the rooms. we had two rooms. one was a 2 double bed room. it was about 20' x 15'. each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies. the furniture, bathroom tile, shower (no tub), wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years. a chinese inspired cabinet held tv, coffeemaker, ice bucket, and mini-bar. three separate levels (tv, ice/coffee, and minibar) the other room was called ""queen executive"". this one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence, sofabed, two tvs and terry bathrobes. also about the same size but different configerations. one tv faced the bed, other in the three level cabinet, the sofabed. smoke in the lobby. there is a bar to the right of the entrance. it is an open arrangement so that i am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door. no smoke smell in no-smoking rooms. cost of rooms $75 on priceline plus taxes. very good value one block from n. michigan ave. only complaint. concierge said that the free trolley didn't go down michigan ave to field museum/museum complex when in fact it does. was this ignorance? or trying to throw more business to taxi? either case, not good. he said at this time of year free trolley only goes to navy pier during winter....which is clearly incorrect.

"the knickerbocker hotel is fantastic! it's an old hotel with updated rooms - so you get the old-timey charm and fresh comfort all at once. the hotel has a fabulous location. it's a one minute walk to the cheesecake factory and bloomingdales, and about a 5 minute walk to einstein bagel company (the best bagels and cream cheese ever), macys and saks. this location can't be beat. you're at one end of the magnificent mile, so it makes for easy strolling, as you don't start in the middle and then backtrack. the hotel staff are super helpful and friendly. checking in and out was very smooth, and the concierge (cheryl) was amazing. she booked all our dinner reservations and activities for us, and recommended an incredible restaurant called carmines which was a 5 minute walk. it was the greatest italian restaurant i have ever been to, and i can't recommend it more. the rooms are small but not too small. we had a beautiful big samsung flat screen, cordless phones, a rain shower, ample clean towels, and beautiful marble countertops. the hotel rooms have european charm to them and made me feel like i was at a 5 star hotel in europe. the beds are very comfortable and the duvet is soft like butter. the only complaint i had was that housekeeping woke us up at 8:30 one morning when the knocked on our door despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on. when we answered and asked her to come back later she seemed a bit miffed. the issue was corrected, though, and it didn't happen again during our 4 night stay. the hotel has some unique items on their room service menu - ie - grilled cheese with mini tomato soup for dipping. very cute. their late night menu, however, is lacking. it would have been nice to see some soup on there. that being said, i rarely order from room service when on vacation, so i really don't see that being a big deal. overall i would recommend this hotel without hesitation. i think we paid about 130 a night and i would say it was worth far more than that. we had a wonderful experience and i truly look forward to staying there again....wouldn't stay anywhere else!

"our third stay at the homewood suites chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two. the staff are consistently friendly, polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door, servicing the rooms, managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk. they genuinely seem happy to be working here and can't do enough for their guests. the rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other (we didn't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy). the hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on michigan ave, or catching a bus or subway. there is a jewel osco and a trader joes each within a couple of blocks, which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc. my husband heartily recommends 'binnies beverage depot' for a huge variety of beer. now all we need is an excuse to return to chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the homewood suites, because we wouldn't stay anywhere else!

"i travelled to illinois from the uk on business, and booked friday and saturday night at the homewood suites so that i could have a weekend in the city. the location was perfect, walking distance to michigan ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff, and literally 100 yards to the l (red line) for getting out to the surrounding areas. the room was great: not exactly 'wow' decor but clean and really well stocked. i was expecting a 'suite' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. it was actually a 3-room mini-apartment, with an open lounge/kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. two flatscreen tvs and a huge bed. breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover(!), and the kitchen meant that i could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed.

"i stayed for just one nite at the sheraton hotel and towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other ta posters but i was not let down. i got the room via pl @ $70 and was first placed in a room on the 8th floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot. since i had nothing to lose, i asked to be moved to a ""room with a view"". the front desk attendant( rasheeda) wanted to make sure that the room i had at first was clean and was in order and i assured her that it was. she then moved me up to the 24th floor with ease and it took about 1 minute. i was quite surprised as i have heard that they treat pl and hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers. the new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the navy pier, a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of lake michigan. all this for $70? yep! i skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious! the room was comfy, had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location. i didnt use it since i wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk. the bed and pillows were very comfy, but i awoke at about 330 in the morning sweating from the comfy but very warm and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed. this was a great deal for the price and i would absolutely stay here again.

"having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website, i arrived tired from ireland, to find that they had mislaid my booking and had no room on that night, but did have rooms for the rest of the week. they booked me in to another (not as nice) downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights accommodation. on my return to the hotel next day, i was upgraded to the club level. what really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake...unprompted. of course, the hotel itself (particularly on the 32nd floor) is excellent. i will definitely be back.

"i recently stayed at the fairmont chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. staff was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in aria restaurant, to the maid who cleaned my room. the rooms were recently updated, with large flat-screen tv's, beautiful linens, and exceptional toiletries in each room. my room even had a view of monroe st. harbor. it is truly a first-rate hotel. location is south of the river and east of michigan ave -- as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way (if that's possible in downtown chicago), however its location significantly lowers street noise. the hotel has excellent access to millennium park, the aon center (there is a connecting concourse), and is about 4 blocks from shopping on north michigan ave. i ate dinner in aria and it was fantastic! room service for breakfast was quite good as well. overall, i'd stay again in a minute if i had business in the loop, or leisure plans in millennium or grant parks.

"stayed in a junior suite which was beautiful and spacious. it had the largest flat screen tv i have ever seen in a hotel (great excuse to catch up on some movies) the breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge atrium which was nice. the service was top notch. stayed in a lower floor in the east tower which was great as there was no waits for an elevator and they were always empty. the shed aquarium was a complete waste of time and money but the field musium was amazing. chicago remains tied with london as my favourite city.

"i stayed at the fairmont to attend a conference. i was very pleased with the hotel. the doorman offered me an umbrella as i headed out for a walk... and sure enough it started to rain very soon after- i would have been soaked with it. upon my return, the doorman then asked about my walk, etc. this is reflective of all the staff i encountered. the front desk promptly checked me in. definitely register for their rewards program before you arrive... the complimentary gym access is excellent, plus you save on internet access fees which are waived for members. the bathroom and separate dressing areas were large and convenient. the only negative- no coffee maker! and the starbucks in the adjacent building is closed on weekends since the area corporate offices are closed those days!!! otherwise my stay was perfect, considering the conference rate was $99 per night!

(it's connect to nordstroms right in the heart of downtown. ) great for shopping. the hotel itself was fabulous. the staff was extremely helpful in giving suggestions for shows and restaurants. i recommend going to joe's that's right across the street from the hotel. everyone was raving about it . . .but we couldn't get a reservation. the room was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. it had a very warm and inviting atmosphere. my husband loved the workout room. i highly recommend the conrad!!

"i got a sunday night stay for only $50 off of priceline.com, so it would be hard to complain...but this was truly a great hotel, even if i paid double. the first impression you get when you walk through the sliding doors of the hyatt regency chicago is wow. the lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant, plenty of couches,seats etc to people watch and a lake with water fountains. you take the escalator to the concierge/directory/check in area. the hotel let me check in at 12pm (i had a 3pm check in time). i suggest you call ahead like i did so they know you are coming early.the women at the desk was friendly and when i requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me ""i have a room on the 18th floor with a veiw of the river or you can go higher with no view"". i thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that i wouldnt get stuck with a room with a view of a wall. the rooms are big (i had a doubles room) the beds were beautiful with great pillows,blankets,headboards etc. an ipod alarm clock was a nice 21st century touch to the room. great to plug in your ipod, listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring chicago. the view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries. another great feature is the concierge area's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport. you simply look at the screen, click on your airline icon and following the instructions. i had my boarding passes in about a minute. came in handy when i got to ohare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers. i was only in the hotel for 1 day, but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences i have had and i travel alot. it is a business hotel, but definitely a great choice for families and couples. definitely would stay here again when im passing through chicago.

"we went to chicago to see an exhibit at the art institute and selected the fairmont because it was so close. although the lobby is still being renovated, our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive. the room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate. the only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished. the maid does not do that, and by bedtime on the first night, we still didn't have coffee. we called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply. the restaurant is a little underwhelming, but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks, we probably wouldn't have eaten there any more than we did. after having stayed in close to a dozen different chicago hotels, this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return.

"just back from 5 night stay at omni and would thoroughly recommend it. staff bent over backwards to assist in anything, no matter how minute. great location on magnificent mile and lots to do there both for adults and my 10yo daughter. if i had to find a fault it would be the extra charges, taxes etc for room service, bar and restaurant, but where is cheap these days? would definitely recommend it, especially for families.

"we stayed at the fairmont two nights for the sofa art fair at the navy pier. i was impressed that the bellman called us by name when he met the taxi and pronounced it correctly, which is quite unusual. everyone smiled and welcomed us. the lobby looks clean and friendly, not ultramodern, but not at all tired or worn. our room, also clean and comfortably furnished, was larger than we expected, with a clean, modern bath and a lovely view of the navy pier and the lake. we did not eat at the restaurant, but it looked attractive. our only problem was that we had asked for non-feather pillows, upon reserving the room, upon checking in, and calling housekeeping. after waiting an hour, we went to bed. the next day the check-in desk person was extremely apologetic and by the time we returned, all the feathers were replaced with foam and non-allergenic materials. the hotel is convenient to millenium park and michigan ave. we would stay there again, assuming we could get good rates.

"i stayed at the omni for one night following a business meeting at another downtown chicago hotel. i was completely impressed by the service; all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding. i checked in quite early (no problem) and was efficiently checked in. my room had a somewhat heavy scent of air freshener (the only negative from the entire stay), which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows. i don't generally require much during my hotel stays, but suffice to say the doorman, housekeeping, the night manager and bartender at 676, the day waiter at 676, and the concierge were amazing - i never waited more than about 30 seconds for anything. the room was very comfy and the amenities were superior. one very tiny complaint - there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar - had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to dispose of kleenex/coffee paraphernalia. one wastebasket would make all the difference. all that said - what a great hotel!! thanks, omni - i had a great stay!

"we stayed at omni chicago for 2 nights in early july (july 1-3). the reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on travelzoo. we got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for food&beverages. i also signed up for their loyalty program, which was so worth it. i was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second-class guest because of the price we paid. but i was totally wrong! they treated us extremely well. before our arrival, i got an email asking if we needed anything. so, i asked for a fridge to store the baby milk. and they arranged it for us without charge :) we arrived late on thursday night. our room was ready for us upon our arrival with the fridge i requested. we were given a corner suite on the 10th floor...very nice room...comfy bed. my husband was really wowwwww!!! the bed was made ready for us - both in the bedroom and the sofa-bed (we didn't use the sofa-bed though). we got a high-speed internet as part of the loyalty program. all staff were friendly and helpful...front desk, valet parking, bell boy, room service, concierge,... everyone! we used the voucher for room-service breakfasts both morning. the first day was great. food was great, and quick. we also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program. we ordered oj and hot chocolate. they both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning. but we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible. it tasted like left-over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate :( also, we ordered belgian waffle for our breakfast, which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries...but we got a plain waffle. so, we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those. this is why i didn't give ""5"" for service. however, i reported these issues to the front-desk when checking out, and the front-desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal. another thing is that it's quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor. we could hear siren going on & off during the night. but this is out of the hotel's control though. and i would say that it didn't bother us at all. my baby could sleep very well. overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely consider omni for our next trip to chicago.

"we recently completed our second stay at the fairmont chicago. the check-in process was quick and painless but the front desk staff was almost disinterested in the whole procedure. that is fine when i am traveling on business, but on leisure trips i would appreciate a warmer greeting. the hotel was hosting a convention at the same time as our stay, but other than seeing some signage/attendees in the lobby, we wouldn't have noticed. this is probably due to the separation of the conference areas from the guest rooms and the 8 speedy elevators. we stayed in a parkview suite so we had a large room with a great view of millenium park. the anteroom was well appointed with a sofa, coffee table, desk, mini-bar with sink and coffee maker, and dining area. the bedroom appeared to be the same as a standard fairmont room, but maybe slightly larger. the bathroom also appeared to be similar to a standard fairmont room, and once again, possibly slightly larger. the upscale modern decor is pleasing but not overtly luxurious, and several small touches such as a shoe shine station (with extra collar tabs), are peppered throughout. we booked a few evening activities through the concierge and everything was perfectly handled. the hotel restaurant, aria, couldn't find our reservation but they oddly new my name and remembered that the hotel had called to make a reservation for us. they had no problem seating us and the dinner (both food and service) was lovely. minor complaints: the pillows could be better. i'm not sure if they remembered our preference for non-down bedding from our last visit, but seriously, these things barely felt like pillows. i'll suffer through some congestion if i can get better neck support. also, the valet parking attendants seem overly eager to take your car (and charge you $49). and as i mentioned above, the front desk experience could be improved. best feature: after our first stay, i gave a brief review in the comments section of the fairmont president's club (membership is free) website. i received a phone call from the director of rooms the same day asking to discuss our experience. after this stay, i left a comment essentially thanking the hotel staff for a great stay, but still received a warm, friendly phone call from the director of rooms asking if he could do anything to improve our next stay. kudos to the fairmont for taking its customers seriously, and for that, they've won my loyalty.

"i'll keep it short. my wife, daughter and i stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. we go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel. location: it is located in the center of the magnificent mile (michigan ave.), so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do. hotel: the hotel itself is very clean, as were the rooms. maid service was excellent, including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service (i think they missed a night). service: every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind. they always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile. every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room (sometimes chocolates on our pillows). they always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it. there was no shortage of people to ask things. my only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get. they shouuld have more than one, or longer hours. other: we had breakfast in the 676 restaurant and it was very good, and well attended, appointed. they even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet. the pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids. it was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking. pool and changing areas were spotless. room: clean, sunny and spacious. probably over 400 sq. ft. - 2 tvs, couch, desk, chairs - all in perfect shape. the windows open for some fresh air. pillows were pretty comfortable. with all aspects considered, i think this was an unbeatable value! i would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend. i truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel. it was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there. omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number. the airlines have cornered the market on that.

"this comes a little late as i'm finally catching up on my reviews from the past several months:) a dear friend and i stayed at the hyatt regency in late october 2007 for one night while visiting a friend and her husband from out of town. this hotel is perfect, imo. easy check in and check out. lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. i know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown chicago attractions. we had dinner and went clubing with our friends around division st.. we had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. parking, as is usual for chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual i would think). no problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through hotwire, a downright steal for this area of chicago and the quality of the hotel.

"i stayed at the fairmont chicago for one night - i'm a frequent business traveler and am very familiar with travel rituals. i checked in late (almost 10pm) due to flight cancellations from my home airport -- atlanta. i took the shuttle to the airport (best option in lieu of the over priced taxis), and it was my first time staying at the hotel. upon arrival, i immediately noticed the entrance, which appeared very welcoming and warm to me. i checked in with no problems -- and the desk person even asked if i'd prefer a king or double (reconfirming my reservation preference). i always take the king when i can, and the bed was fantastic! it was suited with great linen and these incredible down & feather pillows named encompass made by the pillow factory -- i checked the tags, since i plan to buy some! i ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - aria, which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and yes, it does stand out all on it's own. the food is asian fusion, and truly wonderful -- as a gourmand and life-long foodie, i appreciate great food when i taste it! the hotel service was good as well. only drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely. they missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet, which tasted a bit 'metallic'. but they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after i passed on the buffet. i would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view (if you can get a room with one), fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet.

"we have just returned from a week at the james chicago. the hotel is fabulous, very chic and chilled. the service is beyond compare. check in and out were swift and painless. the concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay. the hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in chicago - voted by chicago residents. we stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city. the room (a deluxe king) was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies, hairdryer, safe, tv, robes & slippers, a very interesting selection of minibar items (one of which was a real surprise!) including crisps/snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella! we also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with kiehls products and a cosy little dining area. the ipod dock/cd/radio and complimentary chillout cd were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv. the super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary wifi allowed us to plan our next day's activities from our bedroom. we were so busy touring around the city we didn't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab. the bar/lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more. staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available. the barman mixes a mean mohito ! this hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e.g. the virtual tuck in service - basically a couple of pcs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they're away from home on business. also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends. next visit to chicago i'll definitely be staying here and wouldn't even consider an alternative if the james can maintain these standards.

"my wife and i stayed at the james recently and we had a great experience. the hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. it's in a quiet location, yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. we upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. it didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have, but it was elegantly appointed, spacious, and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. the service was amazing. everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, as well as knowledgeable. this was true from the doormen at the front, to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. both concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions, and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. the breakfast at prime downstairs is among the best i have ever had in a hotel, this goes for the room service as well. dinner there was good, but not great. i mentioned almost flawless, as there was a situation that occurred involving the spa in the hotel. it involved scheduling and was aggravating, as the hotel actively encourages its use. however, caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied, following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. the experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. overall, we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits.

"i stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the chicago bears fan convention (feb 27- march 1). the hotel is beautiful. i had a towers room. i had a decent view of the city (sears tower). the room was a little small but had two bathrooms (1 king bed). the tower room has it's own registration area and comes with a free continental breakfast, evening snacks and free sodas throughout the day. the registration/ lounge is on the 24th floor and overlooks lake michigan. the hotel was full but service was excellent. the location is convenient but there are a number of homeless people within a block or two (especially toward the el train). we loved our stay at this hotel and never had to take a cab or rent a car. i will stay here again. hilton offered a sunday night free on their website with a 3 day stay. this made the cost reasonable (for chicago). however, the pavilion restaurant left a lot to be desired. the pub on the first floor was a good place to hang out and have a drink.

"staying at this hotel was one of the high points of a last minute, budget valentines weekend trip for my husband and me. we got a great rate -- $70 -- on priceline. close to the subway (red line) and we got from o'hare to the hotel in less than an hour for $3.50 for both of us. we were able to check in more than 4 hours early. room was great -- very clean, good closet space and fantastic bedding. had one expensive drink at the irish bar, but the bartender's advice on restaurants and clubs to check out made it worth the price. concierge was helpful, too. overall, service was terrific, room was great and staying there was a treat. i would stay there again any time, especially at that price.

"mostly great with a few islands of relatively minor problems. first the good: outside of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter wonderland, as befitted the season. the restaurant service was absolutely flawless ( servers who don't write orders because they are expected to remember them, remember clients clearly from one day to the other, and go above and beyond consistently). rooms are comfortable: yes the beds are great! the gym is well equipped. second the slightly off putting: mmmhh...we got the ""i love chocolate package"" which advertized: bfast every day, dinner once, snack once and...a gift. and we have an a-club favorite guest membership, which also advertized "" a gift"". so, no gift...either for the chocolate package or the favorite guest membership. upon enquiry, ""the snack was the gift"". not at all what the package suggested. that said, bfast was sublime and the chocolate dinner outstanding as well. some problems at checkout though: we got charged for all dining despite having booked the package and it took quite a while for a polite but seemingly less than informed front desk staff to correct the problem. would absolutely go back, but probably not on a special package.

"stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for 3 nights in early april 2007. very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the golden mile. good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice french twist. dinner at the restaurant was also good. prices are reasonable. room is comfortable, only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening. excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff. would definitely stay here again if visiting chicago. concierge recommended a small van tour, which was excellent. however early april is too early to visit chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of chicago was not operating yet.

"the talbott hotel claims to be chicago's premiere small luxury hotel. after staying there and experiencing the service, environment, and the hotel in general, i can say with confidence that this just isn't true. i arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and i was immediately disappointed. no one came to my car to collect my bags and i was forced to lug them inside myself. the doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me, leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags. once inside, the atmosphere was not what i expected. the lighting was poor, leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building. the carpet looked dirty, as if it hadn't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time, and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage. when i arrived at the front desk, i was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me. after checking in i went up to my room and was once again disappointed. the bed was very uncomfortable and i ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water. that night i ordered room service. the food took 45 minutes to get to my room, and when it finally arrived it was cold. the fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them. i would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends, and probably not to my enemies either. stay away!

"i recently stayed at the affinia hotel in chicago, and it was one of the worst experiences i've ever had at a high-end hotel. i was in chicago for a conference, and i thought i would enjoy the experience more if i had somewhere pleasant and relaxing to return to, but this hotel definitely wasn't that place. the restaurants were mediocre at best, despite their high prices; i repeatedly got food that was bland, overcooked, or lukewarm. the room was fine, but nothing special; i think i'd have been just as comfortable in almost any hotel in downtown chicago. a big part of my discomfort and dissatisfaction with the hotel, though, was with their jet set pets program; it's hard to find a decent, relaxing hotel that i'll like that will also accept my dog. but many of the employees were rude about my adopted mutt, who is energetic and loves people but isn't the most photogenic dog - he has a scar on his face and he's got that terrier look. multiple people mocked him, or said there was no point grooming him, or asked why i wanted him sleeping on a bed in my room. i know that it's a fairly high-end hotel, but i would hope for better service regardless of the class associations of the dogs. i hope they at least treat all of the dogs boarded there well. the experience was overall frustrating and unsatisfactory, especially for the price. i can give them good marks on their spa services, and i really appreciated the pillow ""menu,"" but other than that it didn't feel like a particularly luxurious or indulgent experience, especially given the customer service.

"i stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago recently for a convention i was attending. this was my first trip to chicago and i had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so i had high expectations. check-in took a bit longer than i would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations. once i did get into my room, there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a non-smoking room. i went down to the front desk and requested a room change. given their computer problems, that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and didn't have the ""positive attitude in spite of any difficulty"" i'd expect from such a high profile establishment. the new room was not a suite as i had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling. when i hooked up my laptop, i was dismayed to discover that there was no wi-fi service. i had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wi-fi for online ressies, but as part of their computer problems, the wi-fi service was down. fortunately, there was a starbucks up the street with available wi-fi. granted, i couldn't lounge at the starbucks in my jammies like i could in my hotel room, but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices. i was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management. however, the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management. a quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while i was down the street at starbucks. they did as promised and when i arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customer's dna and the dust bunny population had been eradicated. once i had a chance to relax in the room, there were a few minor details that stood out. the carpet was starting to get worn in places, the edges on some of the furniture was dinged, and my personal pet peeve... the inside of the drawers were rough, unfinished wood which i dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes. i would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel. but, all things considered, my stay was tolerable. water pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep. the wi-fi was still down in the morning so i checked out early and spent my time enjoying a latte and free wi-fi at starbucks.

"warning! my stay at the talbott hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels. i was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends. after receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the talbott. they were promoting up to $30 breakfast credit per day. and breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time. upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee (which we wouldn't have known had he not told us) that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group. once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to king suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved. if someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms i would have sworn we were at motel 6, not a luxury hotel in chicago. the linens were stained, room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee. i was truly disgusted. after a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep. the next morning i was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests. i have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts i have ever eaten. the toast was stale, eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs, and the juice they served was sour. i would never recommend this as a place to stay. i would suggest the red roof inn over this place anytime.

"i had high hopes for the ambassador east hotel, i really did. it seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access. i arrived to the hotel on a tuesday afternoon. i was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in. i could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck, doing nothing. as i walked in, nobody greeted me, and nobody offered to take my bags. the hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated, with a fine covering of dust. i went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys, all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer. i got to my room, and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking, there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway. having paid extra for an upgraded room, i was extremely disappointed by the condition inside. the drinking glasses were filthy, the towels smelled of mold, and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can. the television was a basic crt that looked to be about fifteen years old, and there was no channel guide, though i suppose i didn't need one for the six channels that it had. i had heard good things about the food at the ambassador east hotel, but alas, there was no respite here. the room service that i ordered took forty minutes to arrive, and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done. elsewhere in the hotel things were no better. everywhere i went, from the pool to the bar, the staff was hasty, rude, and completely uninterested, and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated. i really wanted to like the ambassador east hotel, but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out.

"for all the hype and rave reviews of the talbott hotel, it seemed to me that it would be a mistake to not stay there, not the other way around. the talbott hotel website claims to have ""opulent accommodations, impeccable service, and unexpected delights."" the last time i checked, ""opulent"" had a bit of a different meaning than ""easily outdone by the senile 90-year-old landlord of your college apartment,"" ""impeccable"" wasn't code for ""rude and unfriendly,"" and ""unexpected delights"" were more fun than a faint but obvious stain on your sheets at a hotel. overall, my stay here simply wasn't worth the money or the hassle involved in making the correct reservations. for a lot less,i could have been treated rudely and had a mediocre stay in a more casual environment.

"a few weeks ago we stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago. the hotel was a bust from the get go. as we arrived in the lobby, we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up. (we could hear her talking in the back for 5 minutes.) when she got to the desk she was very short with us and not very helpful. we had to wander around the halls looking for our room. once we got to our room, we thought the weekend was going to get better. the rooms are modern and nicely designed. that was about all that this hotel had going for it though. as soon as we started to explore the room more, it was clear this room had been a haven for a party a few nights before. the bathroom smelled of vomit and the bath tub had small shards or glass from broken bottles in it. we called a worker and they cleaned most of it up, but the thought of it still remained. as we all settled down to sleep, there were a few loud noises coming from the room next door. after about an hour, we finally made a call to the front desk to complain. the woman said that a rock band was in that room and they had just finished a show in chicago. they were staying there the next 2 nights. i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone! it's a hard rock hotel all right. (at least that's what the beds feel like!)

"the ambassador east is a particularly crappy property, given the numerous quality hotels in and around the gold coast. unfortunately, i saw an amazing rate and decided to book -- this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for. while the lobby was gorgeous (and appears to match the photos on the website) the room i was assigned was run down, and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website. it looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls, but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty. the room also smelled of must or mildew. while the room did have air-conditioning as advertised, it was an in-window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg. i was only here for a single night, but had i been here for anywhere longer i would have requested a refund. please, if you're staying in this part of town, do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here. the hampton inn and hilton garden inn are both nearby, clean, and often have special-offers -- these aren't the only properties in the area, but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay.

"i would not reccomend staying at the hard rock hotel chicago if you want a good deal and a good nights sleep. i stayed at the hard rock hotel chicago for two nights this past july. i had a select king city view room. the room was dark, with ugly black carpets and the view was of another building right next door - not a great view. i was on an upper level floor and the elevators were incredibly slow. the hotel was pretty loud and the people in the room next to mine were up partying all night long, so it was very hard to get to sleep on my first night there. when i called to complain at the front desk they promised to do something about it but never did. i ended up having to call two more times before the management did something about the room next door. they quieted down for about an hour, but then were loud again for the rest of the night. the hotel was expensive, and for the price there weren't very many special amenities. there was no continental breakfast and the wifi was not included -- you had to sign up for a day of service at $10 a day. overall i would not recommend staying at the hard rock hotel chicago, as it is way overpriced for what you get.

"the affinia in chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences. if you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for affinia, do not expect any measure of customer service and don't expect great accommodations, even at their high prices. when we arrived our reservation was lost, then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available. the furnishings in the room were cheaply made, the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel's l shaped corridor. i called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time. two hours later someone came. the dining hall and reception areas were really nice, but again, unless you're a large group don't expect to enjoy them during your stay at affinia. even if you could, the prices wouldn't be worth it.

"we originally made reservations for a weekend getaway but after looking at their website, read about their ""romantic weekend getaway."" having never been in the area before or stayed at an ambassador hotel we really didn't know what to expect, but the pictures online made it look more inviting than it turned out to be. upon arriving, the parking valet was on break and we ended up having to park our own car, unless we felt like leaving it in the line of traffic. it only went downhill from there. the bed sheets had footprints on them and the bathroom had an odor that we couldn't figure out what it was. we ended up getting a different room, which was very mediocre. needless to say, we won't be staying here again.

"my experience at the ambassador east hotel was truly terrible. i went to chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding. this hotel was recommended by the wedding party. it was a terrible choice. despite the special discount we got because of the wedding, the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels. the staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children. my kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason. the place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items. my son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart. overall, i would say i was very displeased with the staff, the hotel's attitude towards children, and the expense of the hotel. on the plus side, our window had an excellent view of the city. still, i would not return here again.

"hard rock hotel boats that they have the best of the high scale accommodations for your business or pleasure stays. what they fail to disclose is just how expensive your stay will be. the service tends to be heavily influenced by the wealth of the patrons, service is more redily available and friendly the more you make.the rooms are furnished with attractive but old furnishings. the laundry service leaves more to be desired. the sheets have a gray tint to them and the rooms smell of tobacco. i recently stayed at the hard rock hotel and was disappointed with not only the service but the cleanliness of the room from the bathroom to the bedding.your stay at any hotel should be memorable and restful-after all isnt that what we pay for?

"we chose the talbott hotel primarily for the location, but quickly discovered that the location was the only good thing about it. although their website did a good job of selling their services and amenities, we found both severely lacking. we had mentioned to the reservationist when booking that this was to be a romantic weekend getaway for us - it was our anniversary. we asked for, and were promised, a king room. however, when we checked in, we were told by the front desk clerk that no king rooms were available. we could either take a double queen room, or pay significantly more for a suite. we took the key for our double queen room and were on our way. upon arriving on our floor, we found a rowdy group of young girls running up and down the hallway, squealing and playing. it turns out that this hotel offers american girl visits for the nearby store. it turns out that our romantic getaway room was in the center of a block of rooms reserved for a girl scout troop on an american girl trip! we went back downstairs to request a move to another room, and were told no other double queen rooms were currently available. we explained that we were here for our anniversary, and the ambiance wasn't exactly what we were looking for. the clerk rolled her eyes and told us that she couldn't help us - they didn't have anything else. sorry. back upstairs we went. tired from travel, we decided to order from room service for dinner. our pasta, when it arrived, was barely warm and mediocre in flavor. we ate it anyway and prepared for bed. after using the bathroom, we discovered that the toilet in our room continued to cycle water after flushing. after jiggling the handle a few times and poking around in the tank, we couldn't get the water to stop running. it took three hours for a maintenance staff member to make their way up to our room to fix the problem. the next morning, after showering, i discovered the hair dryer didn't work properly. after pulling my wet hair back in a clip, we went out for the day. upon our return, we expected to find our room made up and fresh. it hadn't been touched. we called downstairs to have someone sent up to clean it, but by the time we'd left for dinner, nobody had arrived. our room wasn't made up that day. that night, the girl scouts sat in the hallway giggling and singing until well after 1am. we asked them several times to be quiet, but they didn't want to listen, and their chaperones were nowhere to be seen. we called down to the desk, and they told us ""they would take care of it"", but the girls continued to have their party in the hallway anyway. nobody came to shoo them away. the next morning, i turned on the hairdryer, expecting it to work after reporting the difficulty the day before. it didn't! stuck wearing my clip again, we checked out and made a mental note to select another hotel in the area for our next trip. this hotel had potential, but the staff doesn't care enough about your experience to allow me to recommend it to other travelers.

"the staff at the talbott hotel was completely unresponsive when i told them there were a bunch of drunken teenagers playing ding, dong, ditch. the sheets smelled funny when i arrived and were only changed 6 times during my two-week stay. the room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap, but i did notice the contents of the mini-bar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room.

"affinia chicago is one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at. not in my life have i been treated so poorly as a guest. the front desk was very unaccommodating when i asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation. there was no bellhop available for some strange reason so i had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself. if it wasn't already a bad stay, i ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered. if they didn't have air conditioning in the room, i would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable. if you are traveling to chicago for any kind of business, i hope you decide not to choose this hotel. i was quite surprised, i like chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience.

"my wife and i stayed at the abassador east hotel in august to attend the air and water show in chicago. i called ahead to ensure a sw view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches. upon arrival at the hotel, not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it wasn't even a single king as was requested. apparently the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room. the room itself was small and underwhelming. the was not dirty, but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel. the hotel was packed the weekend we visited. the staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. the concierge and reception desks were continuously busy. the hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits. the main lobby and other common areas throughout the hotel were also undergoing renovations making getting around and fighting crowds of other people even more difficult! luckly the weather was nice and the airshow was enjoyable. we will not be staying at the abassador on future trips. hopefully, current renovations will provide a much needed lift to the hotels current worn down vibe...

"this hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat. the first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket. this place looks alright in the lobby, but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in chicago, this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night. clearly the ambassador east hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession. not to mention that it is at least 30-40 minutes from the airport in traffic. chicago traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached, particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call.

"i recently stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago during labor day weekend, huge mistake! when i got to my room everything seemed okay,until i went into the bathroom. there was a steady drip noise coming from the bathroom sink and no matter how hard i turned the knob, it would not stop. there was none of the usual bath soap nor was it stocked with any toilet paper. it also seems that housekeeping just swept everything behind the toilet as i saw a wad of hair, and scraps of tissue behind the bowl. i called the front desk and ask them to send someone up to stock the bathroom and clean it. while i was waiting i turned on the air conditioning because it was kind of warm in there.... the a.c. started blowing out hot, musky air and had the room smelling horrible. i made another phone call to front desk and complained and asked them to switch my room. they told me all they had available was a double bed and it was near an elevator. i was so frustrated between the odor and the steady drip i was hearing i had no choice but to take it. when i moved to the new room, there was now a large damp spot near the window which smelled very strongly of beer and the light in my bathroom would not turn on. front desk once again sent someone to my room to fix the problems and finally 2 hours later, i was able to relax and settle in. hard rock is definitely not what it used to be and for that reason, i will not be staying there again.

"for a hotel that touts its luxury location in chicago the talbot is very poor (think motel 6 at a hilton price). carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin. they are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks, so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of. for the prices they charge ($350.average price for two people). it seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby, which was happening while i stayed, could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms. but i guess the talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests, which i won't be.

"our trip to chicago was a complete delight despite our stay at the affinia hotel. because their rates were actually higher than we were used to in new york city, we naturally assumed we would get a nicer establishment. we could not have been more wrong. this place focuses on gimmicks to set themselves apart from their competition. uunfortunately, it does set them apart but in a strictly negative way. both the ""dream pillow menu"" and the ""experience kit"" were a complete flop. with the ""dream pillow menu"", the hotel offered patrons what seemed to be great pillow choices from down-stuffed to hypoallergenic selections. we happily chose the fluffy down pillows but when we got to our room and laid down on them a giant poof of dust came out. at first, i thought it was my imagination so i stood up and hit the pillows on the edge of the bed. more dust came out them! particles were flying around the room, i'm now sneezing and there was this disgusting grit all over my sunglasses that were sitting on the night stand. i called the desk and they sent up replacements for all the pillows. these pillows were some kind of ""music pillow"" that pluged into an mp3 player. i was sleeping on uncomfortable cords all night. in general, the staff was pleasant and tried to be accommodating, but there was just no apology good enough for filthy pillows. another failed gimmick they offered was the ""experience kits"". we were given (ours to keep) a collection of some maps (which were actually very nice), a walking tour guide that was all marked up, and a handy deck of cards opened and missing two cards. if this place lacked attention to detail, that is one thing, but it lacked any attention at all. if the pillows weren't already enough, at this point i was certain that i would never stay at this establishment again. run, don't walk away from this place.

"the talbott hotel is a place to stay where the staff treat you like you are not welcome. if you do not pay higher prices you are snubbed and the rooms are no classier or fancier than a standard motel. the room service takes over an hour and there is constant traffic and construction outside. the cost is far more than the luxury. the best thing about staying at this hotel are the bathroom towels.

"i was really excited when we booked a night at the hard rock hotel in chicago. it was actually beyond our budget, but my husband and i needed a weekend away, so i decided to splurge for the occasion. worst waste of my money ever!!! our room was smaller than pictured online, and it looked like the maid didn't vacuum the carpet! we visited the hotel restaurant, angels and kings, one night for dinner and the drinks were overpriced and my husband's steak was cooked wrong (he ordered medium, but received a well-done steak). by the end of our trip we were so glad to leave, but they were under-staffed and the sunday morning checkout line was so long that we waited in line for 30 minutes until we could check out. chicago was a fun city, but next time we return i'll be choosing a different hotel - and i suggest you do too!!

"my wife and i stayed at the affinia chicago last week (in a studio suite, which was not worth the extra payment). it was an absolute nightmare! to begin with, the room is listed as 'oversized', when it's nothing of the sort. we've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller. i believe the only extra space was in the closet, which isn't very useful unless you plan on living there! we had our two sons with us, so we had to make extra sleeping space. our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time, complaining of bugs moving around. he must have been umcomfortable also, as i sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock. the room service is horrible, they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm, and she had to wait up for that. my family would never go back to this hotel, and i highly recommend you also stay well away.

"this was my first time staying at the hard rock hotel in chicago and i have nothing but hate for the entire experience. the building itself is maintained, however the staff is rude and inept to the point of making their customers feel physically ill. and while the outside appearance is fine and dandy, my room 325, was repulsive. as soon as the bellboy threw my luggage onto the room's ground and verbally demanded a tip, i noticed insects of all kinds scurrying around, the room was pungent with what smelled like human excrement, before i could say anything to the bellboy he had taken his tip and fled. immediately i went to the front desk and was made to wait for over a half hour, a complete waste of time, because as soon as i had reported my problem i was told that no other rooms were available and i would have to make do, they did however say i could stay the night free of charge. the next morning as i was set to leave i decided i would try the breakfast, in hopes of finding one redeeming quality. let me tell you, that breakfast tasted like space food with dirt and mold, the worst breakfast i have ever had in my entire life. overall the employees are arrogant and callous, with the work ethic of a 2 year old child, they cannot cook, the room for me was poorly maintained, however they are good at refunding your money.

"my recent stay at the talbott hotel in chicago was miserable. my visit began on the wrong foot when they couldn't locate my reservation. i had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they couldn't find me ""in the system"". we finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over. that process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations. the room that i had originally reserved (king) was not available and i had to wait 45 minutes for them to clean a double room. i was so tired from the traveling and the hassle at the front desk that i decided to stay in and order room service. it took an hour and a half for my food to arrive. when finally delivered, it was cold and not exactly how i had ordered it. so now i am cranky, tired and starving! i ate what i could from the mini bar (poor selection of items) and went to bed. the room was spacious but had a stale smell to it, as if someone had smoked in it. the next morning i complained and wanted to change rooms. the woman at the front desk couldn't be bothered with me and didn't try to make things right in any way. i decided to check out and go to another hotel for the remainder of my stay in chicago. i will never waste my time or money at the talbott again.

"after reading good reviews about the affinia hotel in chicago, my husband and i decided to spend two nights there to celebrate our 30th anniversary. unfortunately, the hotel missed the mark for us. i did not expect to find bedbugs underneath the mattress in a 4-star hotel. because my husband and i have had a bad experience with bedbugs, as a rule, we always check underneath the mattress before settling down for the night in any hotel. when i brought this to the attention of the front desk staff, they practically accused us of planting the bugs there. i was very humiliated and disappointed in the way the situation was handled. needless to say, we made the decision to pack our bags and went elsewhere to celebrate our anniversary. i have written a letter to the hotel chain and hope that they will be more responsive to the situation. i have also reported the incident to my credit card company to alert them that i will be refuting the charge for the one night the affinia charged to my account because we missed the cancellation deadline.

"i had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at the talbott hotel in chicago. i thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom, shopping and enjoying a bit of chicago's exciting night life. i found the talbott hotel's website and decided the american girl package they offer was what i was looking for. the price sounded reasonable, so i booked a room. the two of us were so very excited to spend some time together. we arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5:00 on that friday afternoon. after making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room wouldn't be available for another hour. they blamed this on shortage of maids that day. they did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe's but this wasn't a good start to our special weekend. when we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package wasn't in the room. this disappointed my daughter, she was looking forward to that. while they did find a bed and bring it to us it just wasn't the surprise we had imagined. the rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly. we managed to have a good time together even though the service wasn't quite what is claimed on the website. would i go to the talbott hotel again? probably not.

"what was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in chicago turned into a complete disaster. the first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in...they knew we had 6! we ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel. when we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other. after some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor, unfortunately one of the rooms hadn't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around. the staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating. on our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5:30am. despite my calls to the front desk, the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes. we also didn't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly. one morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door. i understand they allow pets, but really...people need to clean up after their animals...or have some dog free floors. while hard rock hotel in chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms, their service was terrible, the staff was rude, and i still can't get over that dog poo in the hallway. i definitely won't be staying here again.

"upon entering my hotel room at the palmer house hilton i immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom. after placing my bags on a poorly made bed i walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet. i immediately called room service and asked for a new room. they apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess. after oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door. she seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if i should have been the one dealing with it. after the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip. i hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room. i thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod. yes you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor. and nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air. when i was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own. if i wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa. after giving up on a nice television program i decided to retire to bed. egyptian sheets? right! all i can say is i found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour. if you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel.

"the hilton family would be outraged after hearing about a recent stay (i.e. nightmare) at the palmer house hilton. i arrived 3 days before the national restaurant association tade show hoping to beat the crowds and settle in for a long week of trade show business. when i arrived i was greeted or really snarled at by the clerk. this lady (if one can really call this beast that) was aggressive and rude from the get go. she made a snide comment on the number of bags i had and it was downhill from there. my guaranteed and confirmed reservation had been mysteriously cancelled and she indicated that i had been the one to contact their call center seeking a cancellation. i informed ""brenda"" that i had never cancelled my reservation. we had originally booked 2 rooms (one for me and one for colleague) and my colleague changed their reservation to come in one day later. she huffed and puffed and finally said, oh okay, i read it wrong but we don't have a room for you. my room had been given away to someone else that had arrived earlier that day. as a hilton honors member and someone that drops lots of money on this chain, i was furious. she said that perhaps someone else had found me a room at another hotel and to wait while she checked. she left the front desk and was gone for almost 20 minutes, coming back with a smirk on her face. she informed me that i had to make a decision and that both would not be satisfactory 100%. the first option was to stay at a hotel outside of the chicago downtown, closer to the airport or that i could go with another room they had, a smaller smoking one with the potential but promise of an upgrade in 3 or 4 days. i was outraged. no, i'm sorry and certainly the options were horrible. i ended up taking the smoking room where i barely spent any time in it due to the strong cigarette smells. additionally, there was no upgrade at all during my stay there. i was not offered anything to make up for my troubles, their screw-up nor did the hotel manager bother to return my call. the net outcome: i will never stay at this hotel again and i'm thinking of shredding my hilton honors card. don't make the mistake of dealing with this property. you will be very, very sorry. thanks for reading all this. hopefully it will help someone out there before booking at this joke of a hotel.

"my wife and i decided to stay at the amalfi while we visited friends in chicago; we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this 'luxury' hotel to any of our friends. amalfi claims that your stay begins with a 'warm greeting,' but we received the exact opposite. the front desk clerk was rude, sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question, and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room. apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog, who we had to bring at the last minute. the room on the pet floor was alright, nothing spectacular, and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered-up dog urine. we proceeded to dinner at keefer's restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time. i have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire; opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant. the next day, i could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly, and had to finish some work at our friend's house. my wife had called for some extra towels and pillows, which took about half an hour to receive. she also ordered breakfast because breakfast in bed was her favorite- until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them. we were set to stay for 3 days, but only managed to stay 2. we will not be staying here again.

"our visit started off on the wrong foot when we entered the lobby struggling to carry all of our luggage and, instead of helping, a group of hotel employees stood watching and laughing at us. they had trouble locating our reservation. our room was tiny! when i'm paying over $400 a night for a room, i expect to be able to walk around in it! the beds were also tiny. the walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors talking next door. this hotel was probably once beautiful and classy, but now it seems to be outdated and due for repairs. won't be staying here again.

"the pictures on this website sure are deceiving! in real life the palmer house hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be! the cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning! now, granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but i thought that was the only weird thing i would have to put up with on that trip. it wasn't! they charged us for a mini-bar fee when we don't even drink, no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway! they also did not get our wake-up calls to us on time, so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip. we had to spend $50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we'd planned! and then it wasn't as good because the tour guide wasn't there and we got lost! my husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one. it was terrible! i certainly won't be staying here again!

"problems started when i booked the intercontinental chicago online at the hotel's site, and got a server error. somehow i managed to get my reservation, and wish i had looked elsewhere on this great chicago street, filled with plenty of other options. the server errors continued at check in and didn't let up. i was on a holiday weekend, but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers, and i had trouble getting served. the hotel is enormous and doesn't give a sense of comfort. the health facilities are also just too big, so noisy and crowded. and internet access was $18 a day, kind of surprising when i can go around the corner to a starbucks! next time, i'll pick a more intimate place nearby--without so many ""server errors"".

"the amalfi hotel advertises itself as a ""luxury boutique hotel"" and as such i expected my experience there to be somewhat better than average. unfortunately, this was not the case. the room i booked was not clean; in particular the bathroom looked as if someone had done a very minimal amount of cleaning after the last guest. there was hair in the corners of the room leading me to think the floor had not been swept or cleaned. in addition, although the room was supposed to be a non-smoking room, i could still detect the odor of cigarette smoke. i will say that the staff was courteous and the hotel is very well situated in terms of the many restaurants, sites and shops all within walking distance. however, given the cost of the room and my experience with the cleanliness of the room, i would not stay at the amalfi hotel again.

"since this was our first visit to the ""windy city,"" we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique. we read many great reviews regarding the kimpton brand so we gave it a go. the ""go"" ended up being a ""no go."" we were sorely disappointed. when we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice. we have two kids with us, so we needed a crib for our 6 month baby. we were told ""no problem."" unfortunately, it took them about 1 or 2 hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next. then, we noticed a bug (or bugs) near the fridge area. yikes! we called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room (or floor!). our request was met about 30 minutes later. by this time, we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions, we almost wanted to throw the towel in. customer service was so lacking! we wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city, but had to wait around for our new room and the crib. this is not what we expected at all for this high price! will have to think hard before we book with a kimpton hotel again.

"this hotel was not at all what i expected it would be. the website and it's pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in. the amenities were not what i was looking for, and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there. my aaa membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels. the staff was not very friendly or helpful when i had questions about the area, and they were not very prompt when responding to requests. i understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while i was there, but they need to have more staff on hand if they cannot provide their hotel guests with quality service. i don't think i will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon.

"i recently stayed at this hotel not to long ago. sure, it looks nice, but it's really just a smoke screen. i went to the clerk to check in and she was very rude to me. i was asking about nearby attractions and she abruptly cut me off to tell me that i need to go find a phone book and ask someone else. she also encoded my key wrong, so i had to have it redone. i finaly get to my room, only to discover it was a mess. the sheets were thrown on the floor, the curtains were wide open and to top it all off, the toliet hadn't been flushed. it was horrible. i called the front desk to have a maid come and fix it up, but i was told they were on break. whatever thoguh, i cleaned up myself. the night progresses and i awaken to the sound of someone beating on my door. some guy said that i was in his room. it baffled me, but we went straight down to the lobby and got it cleared up. they had given his the wrong room. i couldn't take one more day of all the bull. i checked out early the next morning and stayed at a different hotel for the remainder of my visit to chicago. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

"although the intercontinental chicago hotel is located on ""the magnificent mile,"" our entire experience as guests there was anything but ....believe me, the ""magnificence"" ends at the hotel entrance! from check-in to check-out, our impressions ranged from lackluster to horrific. first, there was an error with our reservation, and once we got to our room, we found that neither our phone nor our internet connection worked, so down i trudged to the registration desk--where i had to wait in line for at least twenty minutes--to ask for help. the first night we spent was nearly totally sleepless due to tv noise coming from the next room; we weren't sure whether it was due to excessively inconsiderate neighbors or thin walls. then, dog tired the next morning--even though we had hung a ""do not disturb"" sign on our door handle--in barged the maid all bright-eyed and bushy tailed with scrubber in hand. following that rude awakening, i was jarred again by a blood-curdling shriek from my wife, who, upon entering the bathroom to take her shower, was greeted by an incredibly large roach! breakfast--actually all meals of which we partook at the hotel--were served cold and were somewhat tasteless. we were routinely ignored by the concierge, who always seems to be on a personal call whenever we needed him. trying to leave the hotel was equally as difficult as checking in. of course, there was a gross error in our bill which caused us to be delayed in our effort to depart. getting out of the intercontinental chicago was, believe me, the best part of our experience as guests there.

"my husband, three year old son and i arrived at the palmer house hilton last friday for a weekend stay. the hotel looked elegant online but included information that also indicated it was child friendly. at the check in the staff was cold and seemed quite annoyed by son who was merely saying hi and asking the name of the person helping us. one elevator was broken we had a long wait for other elevator. the hallway appeared a bit dirty as we made our way to our room. the room was decent. not deluxe as their website indicated it would be but is was comfortable and the view was good. we had a long day of sight seeing and play on saturday. as my son was tired, we elected to return to our room and have room service for dinner. there was no children's menu for room service. only for the restaurant from which the room service came from the same kitchen, what??? we ordered an adult meal. the food arrived an hour later, cold and unappealing. but we at it because we couldn't wait another hour. although the hotel looks lovely. the service was not very good. most of the staff was cold and snooty. except for the cleaning staff who were very nice. it might be ok for a couple or business traveler but do not stay with children. a comfortable motel might be better.

"my wife and i were excited to visit and shop at chicago's magnificent mile on michigan ave. we chose the intercontinental hotel for it's reputation and location. man oh man, were we disappointed. the check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well. we got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains. there were six people in line for her and we had to wait. that was no problem since we weren't on a timetable. when we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the miracle mile, she just pointed to the door and said, ""it's right out the door."" i asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying, ""there's no such thing."" i couldn't believe her abruptness. we left the concierge stand not wanting to return. shopping went well and was fun. we returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge. we couldn't find a hotel directory in the room. i called the housekeeping department and was told, ""we're all out of directories here in the office."" i asked if they could check a vacant room for one. she said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms. i hung up and thought i would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages. guess what? you guessed it, no phone book in the room. i figured we could go get a drink at the bar, the hotel's 20's themed lounge, and ask the bartender for suggestions. we went to the bar and there were only three other customers. we sat at the bar and got our drinks. as i was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions, his cell phone rang. he answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk. twenty minutes later, he was still on the phone. tired and hungry, my wife and i went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from pizza hut. although the hotel is nice enough and the furnishings comfortable, the indifference of the staff will keep me from ever coming back. a big thumbs down to the intercontinental chicago. they need to look up the word hospitality in the dictionary.

"don't let the website fool you. i stayed at the amalfi hotel chicago on my last business trip, and this was probably one of the worst 4 star hotel i've ever stayed at. the website makes the place look like a 4 star hotel but it's more on par with a 2 stars or 3, if you want to be generous. first off, the rooms are not as nice or clean as they look in the picture. the room that i checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls, and the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since god knows when. since i was only staying one night, i decided not to ask for a different room- although i don't know if asking for a different room would've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk. when i arrived, there were two receptionists chatting it up- no acknowledgement, no prompt service. i had to wait about 3 minutes although i was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me. and no, they weren't talking about hotel matters. i'm not a difficult or an especially picky person, and who doesn't chat during work with their co-workers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism. do yourself a favor, and go stay at the marriott if you want service- unless the price is tempting but you get what you pay for.

"upon my arrival at the hotel allegro in chicago i had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while i waited outside in the towncar. the bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby. the front desk service rep was busy on the phone when i approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call. once i recieved my key and entered my room i realized that i had been checked into a dirty room. i called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that i had previously checked in with told me that there wern't anymore available rooms. she told me that i needed to come back down to the lobby. as i approched the desk i heard her yelling at a housekeeper. she then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready. i didn't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so i just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned. while i was waiting i watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was i not given that suite after what i just went through? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready. i went back up to the same room that i had previously entered. it was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels. i called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items. if my stay wasn't already horrible enough after i changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel i ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation i had made to be seated. the meal was ok but nothing like i had expected it to be when i read about it online. i can honestly say i will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant.

"this hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here. the amalfi hotel chicago advertises itself as a ""luxury hotel"" located in downtown chicago. since it is in downtown chicago, that means that i had street noises keeping me up most of the night. my view also suffered. they had nicer rooms available with better views, but the markups to stay in them was outrageous! the room itself was decent, with clean linens and nice air conditioning, but i can get that in just about any hotel these days. there wasn't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me, but for the price i paid for the room, i certainly had that expectation. it was a let down.

"my daughter wanted to spend the weekend in chicago for her 21st birthday recently, and i wanted to find the best hotel for her experience. i looked at the hotel website and really like hotel allegro's insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services, so i booked us for a friday and saturday night. upon arriving, the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant. not enough to warrant a verbal complaint, but enough to make my daughter and i feel uneasy. after check-in, which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing, we headed to our room trying to be optimistic. our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested, the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound, and we only had a stock of 2 towels, which were never replaced during our stay. we made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel. it was a huge disappointment, for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl. i highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel. there are much better choices in the chicago area.

"recently stayed at the intercontinental chicago magnificent mile and was a little underwhelmed. it's convenient location did not compensate for the fact that the property is very old and definitely in need of some updating and renovating. there is a definite need for some noise control -- everything and everybody could be heard from inside the room. hearing the plumbing from other guests' rooms was particularly annoying. the fitness facilities are really hyped but unfortunately they were not free to use (at least it wasn't included with my booking choice). parking was pretty expensive so if you really don't need it, don't use it. overall, just dissappointed that the great location wasn't matched with great accommodations.

"my wife and i were very much looking forward to our stay at the hotel allegro in chicago. we had been looking forward to a romantic getaway. i have to say hotel allegro was a disappointment for both of us. this is a pet friendly hotel - we knew that going in. but we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given. in the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover. very shocking for the price we were paying. when we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by. past this - the room itself - it has flair i guess, but i can't imagine it is the right flair for many. the colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow, designy wallpaper. neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all. i can't imagine many would. it really was off-putting. overall, the experience was a check minus in my book. will not be looking to return any time soon.

"my wife and i were guests at the hotel allego in chicago for a long weekend getaway (september 2 - 5, 2011). we had checked out the hotel's website long before booking and were quite excited about our trip. once we arrived, the hotel staff informed us that the room we requested was unavailable and brought us to a different room that smelled quite moldy. when i asked to be moved to another room (my wife has asthma) we were politely told that we were unable to be switched at that time. the room was not particularly well-cleaned: we found previous guests hair in the bathroom sink and on the floor, and a film of dust across the television set. we are not the type to complain, so we went out to explore the city and assumed that would be the worst of it. at nighttime when we tried to sleep, we discovered the bed sagged terribly in the middle and the walls were so thin, every nearby conversation could be heard perfectly. we were tossing and turning half the night. in the morning we hoped a quick workout might help energize us for the day, but we discovered that the wellness and fitness center described on the website was really not at all what we anticipated: a few treadmills and a dilapidated weight rack. the concierge was almost never around in the lobby (her sign always said ""be right back!"") and when we did ask her questions, she was actually somewhat cold and rude towards us. the second night was without incident, luckily, except for the terrible bed, but the third night we were woken up three times by hotel staff trying to enter the room to clean despite our ""do not disturb"" sign. i would not recommend this hotel.

"oh my! more like a dank museum than a four star hotel! i read so many reviews on this hotel that i was sure my husband and i wouldn't be disappointed on spending our 10th wedding anniversary in the heart of chicago at such a luxurious hotel! all the reviews sounded great so i feel awkward writing this, but i have to be fair - this place was a major disappointment. while the location is superb, the images online must have been taken over 10 years ago because all of the decor when we visited looked very old and faded. i noticed dirt everywhere - the fabric on the furniture was stained, the baseboards and woodwork were scratched and dirty and there seemed to be a smell of mold and mildew that permeated the entire hotel. even though the food was great, the linens, glassware and silverware were not sparkling - it sort of helped that candles were lit so i didn't focus too much on how dreary and washed out the dining facility was. i didn't realize experiencing history would actually mean staying at a hotel that's living in the past! this was barely a two star hotel and i do not recommend staying here at all.

"i've never written a review before, but i just had to share my experience with chicago's intercontinental hotel. i booked a weekend at this hotel for my wife's birthday. we've never stayed at a luxury hotel before and i thought this would be a great experience for us. the horrors started when we first got to the counter. the clerk mixed up our rooms and when i pointed this out he got really snooty with me. we get to our room and the maid hadn't cleaned it yet! we had to wait around for that, so we went to the hotel's restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced. finally our room is finished and the the ""view"" we were promised was non-existent. to top it off the maid did a terrible job cleaning. the toilet was dirty and we actually found a stain. a stain! on the sheets. what a waste of money. i pointed this out the concierge and we weren't even offered a refund or discount. never again.

"i stayed at the knickerbocker hotel the last time i visited chicago. i lived in illinois during college, and as i was on a college budget, most of my trips up to the city involved sharing a room at one of the cheaper hotels away from downtown. for my visit back, i decided i would treat myself to a nicer stay than i was used to, so i booked a room at the knickerbocker. everything looked nice when i got there, but for the price i paid, i was really expecting something far above and beyond what i got. maybe i wasn't dressed right, or didn't carry the right luggage, but the front desk clerk was unnecessarily snooty when i checked in. shouldn't a hotel try to make its guests feel welcome? when i stayed at the cheap hotels in college, the front desk employees were always friendly when i checked in and out, and they would give me good tips on the best way to get to the fun things in the city. here, i didn't even want to ask for any tips at the front desk because i didn't want to deal with the eye rolling and ""too important to be bothered"" attitude i got when i checked in. i guess the location was more convenient than the hotels i used to visit, but i really thought that part of the money i was spending on a nice hotel would pay for a pleasant customer service experience. look, obviously i can afford to stay at your hotel, i already booked and paid for the room. even if customer service isn't your number one goal, making money should be pretty high up on the list, and making a paying customer feel unwelcome isn't a very good way to secure return business. i doubt i'll stay here again.

"i stayed three nights recently at the hilton homewood suites- downtown chicago. overall i can't rate this establishment highly. the person at the front desk was disorganized- and took over 10 minutes even to find my reservation. once i finally got my key, the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me. it didn't get any better when i got to my suite. the bed was poorly made, and i found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows. the room was very stuffy, and i swear might have even had a vague pet smell. my shower was not very clean- notable hard water stains on the shower door,and the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip. also, the carpets didn't seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable. i also visited their small gym/workout area and was disappointed there also. it had limited equipment that was in poor repair. the floor in there was even slippery, which made it a definite trip hazard. while the indoor pool looked good, as i dipped into it, the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell. all in all, the amenities, the unfriendly service, and the sub-standard cleanliness makes this hotel one i would definitely not recommend to anyone. when that is paired with their sky high room rates, it's just not a place that should earn any repeat guests.

"i really had high hopes for homewood suites when i stayed there on a week-long business trip last month. after all, considering their prices (it's technically a hilton), you would expect something above and beyond a typical cut-rate bargain motel. i'll start with the good stuff about the hotel: it's in downtown. now for the bad stuff: first, everyone is rude. i'm not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp. the bellboy scowled at me in the lobby, was rough with my luggage, and then scowled at me again when i tipped him $5. likewise, the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head. she had to call her supervisor over *twice* just to check me in, and i had a reservation! apparently she was new, and didn't have much experience using the computer, but that's no excuse: it turned what would have been a two-minute process at a decent hotel into 15 minutes of tedium. sadly, the room was no better than the service. the hot water in the sink did not work, the shower was only lukewarm, and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink. complimentary mood lighting, i guess. the tv was a bust; sure it was an lcd, but the espn logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel. and to top it all off, the bed smelled funny. i called the front desk (at least the phone worked), and asked for fresh sheets. the person i talked to said they'd be right up, but never came. eventually, i gave up. i woke up the next morning to back pain (the bed was about as firm as a marshmallow). i left the room, and made my way through the chilly hallways to the ""complimentary buffet."" literally all the food was bad. even the cereal tasted stale. looking around, everyone in the dinning room appeared to be having a similar experience. the sight of two-dozen disappointed people sipping weak coffee and prodding watered-down scrambled eggs with plastic forks was a sight more becoming of a refugee camp than an expensive hotel. just plain sad. worst part was, it was the same thing for the next four days, too.

"i recently had the misfortune of staying at the swissotel chicago hotel in illinois, and it was one of the worse travel experiences i have ever had! first off the shuttle that was suppose to pick us up at the air port was late by over an hour! then when the bus finally came, the driver was nice enough but it was clearly his first day on the job since he got lost going back to the hotel. finally when we got to the hotel they didn;t seem to have our reservation for the 2nd room. (my wife and i stay in one room, our teenage girls usually stay in their own room.) so after the very rude clerk at the corner did nothing to help us we were forced to pack into one room. we would have rented another room but they had no vacancies left. they hotel did have a large occupancy rate, but that only slowed up everything else. our room service was late almost everytime we ordered, and the hotel restaurant never had a wait less then 45 mins. the quality of the room was fair enough, but it was almost impossible to get room service, we could not get fresh towels for almost 2 days! we were suppose to stay for a week, we left after 4 days and found a different hotel to stay at. i would not recommend this place to anyone! stay away!

"when i walked into the millennium knickerbocker hotel, my first thought was ,""wow this is very yellow"", and not the good kind of yellow like a sunny day, no the ugly yellow that you would want to wash off your pretty white blouse. my room was fairly descent although the yellow theme seemed to leak in. it was a victorian feeling in the lobby that turned into a modern feeling in the rooms and bathrooms. i would have liked to see less yellow and maybe a bit more of that fancy feeling from the lobby in the rooms.

"i recently stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel. it was my first time staying at this hotel and, i am sorry to say, it was my last time staying there. one of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise. the walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night i could hear my neighbors in the next room talking. although i could not quite make out the words of their conversations, i could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer. in addition, i was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door, presumably on the way to their rooms. admittedly, i am a light sleeper, but this was ridiculous. if you decide to stay here, i suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out. when i checked mine, i found that i was being charged a rate higher than the one that i was supposed to be charged. i had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me (and the front desk service is woefully slow) and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected. finally, though i had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated, i cannot believe that statement was accurate. the room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn. all in all, i round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing. next time i will arrange to stay elsewhere.

"the sheraton chicago is not the place to be if you want to experience chicago. there are no customer services to provide you with ideas of what to do, and there aren't even any shuttles that will bring you around town. the food in the restaurant at the hotel serves mediocre burgers and fries, and makes no attempt to emulate the chicago culture. there are a million other hotels in chicago, and this is one of the most average. the rooms are fairly decent sized, but they lack amenities like wi-fi and mini bars. the view is nothing special, and the concierge is anything but responsive to phone calls.

"the millennium hotel knickerbocker sounds fine, and the website is pretty, but the reality is an over-hyped, overpriced, reality-isn't-as-good-as-fantasy package. the catering they offer is a joke; you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the chicago area. while the rooms were cleaner than most, there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses, and when i called to complain about it, a nasal-voiced clerk blew me off. the rooms look small but cozy when you book online, but when you get there in person, you realize just how tiny they are. trying to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can -- did i mention that it smelled like cleaning solution? i also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed, which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is. in fact, it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small; you'd get better prices and a far better room from the hilton.

"whatever you do, do not stay at the homewood suites in downtown chicago. i made that mistake, and it was terrible! the bed linens were obviously not clean - there was even a stain on the comforter - and the housekeeping staff there absolutely did not care about doing a good job. our room was only ""cleaned"" twice in a week's stay, and even then only the barest minimum of effort seemed to go into it. they didn't even empty the trash cans! as for the ""in-suite"" kitchen, it was awful. we were hoping to save money by cooking in our room, but with one broken eye on the stove and a nasty, greasy microwave? it seemed a better idea to eat out, and avoid any more unpleasant surprises from their lackluster in-house food. i didn't hear good things about their breakfast offerings, anyways. if i were you, i'd avoid this place like the plague. i know i'm certainly never going back!

"i recently was in chicago on business and chose to stay at the swissotel, chicago. the hotel sells itself as being stylish, sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city. i would have been better off anywhere else. i was not impressed with the interior, finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste. i guess 'stylish' might be modern in some people's minds, but not mine. also, luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical. when i made my way to reception, i hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website. i had organized an executive suite as i was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room, and thought the extra space would come in handy. when i proceeded to check in, the girl at the desk told me, while smacking gum, that i had no reservation. i handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong, even though i had spelled it out for her. she then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference, all of the executive suites had already been allocated, but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room. correct me if i am wrong, but this is a step down from the room i had asked for! surely if you give away my room, you should try to compensate me with something better! i said that no, i really needed more space as i would be using the room as an office, and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available, and that if i wanted to switch the following evening, i would be welcome to do that. the room was ok, although, again, i was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt. i did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services, but found them sadly lacking. some comments on the services: the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect, and also a per day fee which borders on extortion! there was free wifi in the lobby, but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air, plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out. i did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels, but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived. the fitness center and pool which i was looking forward to using, were closed for cleaning when i went up. breakfast the next morning consisted of continental items, which is not what i would have expected for the money. all in all, i would say your money is better spent elsewhere.

"i went to the homewood suites in chicago which is part of hilton's famous hotels. i gotta say that this is the worst hotel that i have ever been to. in fact, homewood suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet. i checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape. in fact, the rooms looked so bad that i wanted to leave the hotel early. i also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel. i saw one of the employees and when i rung the bell for my room, they ignored me. how could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you? one more thing that i hate about this hotel is that the logo didn't look like the actual logo. it looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw. i'll never go to this hotel again and it won't even be in a million years for that matter. this is a hotel that i will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer.

"i was not at all impressed with my stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago. checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 (one!!) front desk agent 30 minutes to process. both guests had issues with their rooms regarding, it seemed, wrong room types and being out of the room type requested. i was nervous about my own reservation and, sure enough, my superior corner room wasn't available. the hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available. i was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel. want internet? upcharge. want extra pillows? upcharge. extra coffee for the room? upcharge. bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating. i won't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking.

"this hotel is overpriced. one should pay money for luxury, but they fall far short considering the prices that they charge. when you go to the hotel restaurants you expect a certain mark-up because, yes, they do have to make money. but the prices they charge for food that was okay makes little sense to me. when i got there and went to my room, i thought that there would be nice colors, a great view, and deluxe bedding. what i got were sheets that might have come from the full price section of target--they were not cheap, but not that expensive either. i think i could have found something of this quality at less than the 200ish a night i paid.

"my husband and i made a reservation at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers, for a much needed weekend getaway. we took off work early friday to beat traffic. once at the hotel we quickly found out that there was not ample parking. we drove around several times looking for a space and had to park in an adjoining lot and walk across a busy side street to gain access to the hotel. upon checking in we were informed that the floor, where our room was located, was in the process of having the carpets cleaned. we decided since we prepaid with our credit card that we were going to make the best of the situation. we took the elevator, which smelled like urine, up to our room. we did see some carpet cleaning machines, unattended, in the hallway. i hoped for the sake of safety, no children were staying on this floor. we walked into our room and my first thought was how much humidity was in the room and it seems one of the guest used the microwave to heat up some sort of spicy curry cusine. the overwhelming scent of burnt curry mixed with the chemical smell of the carpet shampoo were too much for us. we called the desk manager and asked if we could change rooms. he rudely informed us that the hotel was completely booked due to several weddings. just then, the roar of the carpet cleaning machine came through the walls and i could not hear anything else my husband said. we decided to get a refund on our card and leave the hotel. it was an awful experience.

"for the price, you would think this would be a top quality hotel, but it was nowhere close. service at check-in was slow and unfriendly. the room was even worse. it was small, dirty and smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though i had requested a non-smoking room. the cover on the bed was stained, there was hair all over the bathroom floor, and the curtain rod was almost falling off the wall. everything looked tired and in desperate need of a remodel. i also didn't appreciate having to pay for wifi, when other premium hotels offer it for free. overall, this was one of the worst hotels i have stayed at in a long time, and considering the price, it was terrible.

"atrocious. here's our story: my wife and i are californians but met as students at the university of chicago. to celebrate our 10th anniversary, we decided to travel back to the windy city and revisit all of the places we frequented when we were first falling in love. when it came to lodging, we knew we wanted a suite but little else mattered. we wanted to revisit the city and didn't intend to spend very much time in our room. as a result, we didn't spend very much time researching hotels. big mistake. our stay at homewood suites could not have been worse. our room, which, i should mention, took a full two hours for them to prepare even though we had booked it months in advance, was filthy. (my wife found a dead cockroach in the bathroom.) the staff was rude and indifferent. the chocolates included in the romance package could not have cost the hotel more than a dollar. cleaning staff failed to show up. front desk offered apologies but little else. suffice it to say, we checked out early. never before have i seen such a poorly-managed hotel. truly shameful. stay away!

"i stayed with my husband at the homewood suites in chicago. we wanted to do something nice for our anniversary and thought that the hilton was a solid name brand and expected to have a pleasant stay. unfortunately this was not the case! the staff was very rude at check-in (which took 20 minutes) and the lobby smelled musky and gross. the room itself was not like other hilton hotels i have stayed at. the carpeting was atrocious and the color of vomit, the room smelled of smoke (even though it's advertised as smoke-free) and there were a few long brown hairs in our bed! i was so grossed out that i had to call down to the rude staff to ask for our linens to be changed and they gave us a huge attitude about it. and don't even get me started on how poorly the shower/bathtub worked..a nice anniversary went totally awry due to how crummy this hotel is. if i could give it 0 stars, i would!

"i was sorely disappointed with the sheraton chicago. from the outside it looks like a great hotel, and i guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy, not what i expected when looked at the website. the front desk staff was nice enough at first, but when i asked for the wifi password they told me i had to pay extra. i mean come on, i'm paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is extra? the lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation. (note to self, don't let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd.) so things started off on the wrong foot anyhow. i guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview (from some of the rooms) and it seems pretty safe. other than that i was not impressed for the price - i've stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens, a better restaurant, where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour (we stayed two nights and we didn't get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5). i guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell. in general it seems lke it's on the decline and the staff knows it, they're just kind of lackadaisical. i wouldn't stay there again.

"not one of my better experiences, when i first arrived at the hotel and tried to get my room key it was discovered that they were fresh out of keys. i had to wait half an hour while someone ran out to get more keys. it wouldn't have been as bad but the lobby looked to be in slight disrepair. when i finally got to the room i found the burnt out light bulb and an unmade bed. the room was an ok size for one person but any more than that and it would probably get a bit crowded. but the view from the window was amazing, and it took away some of the bad for me. overall, it just felt like the owners of the hotel stopped caring, maintenance took four or so hours to finally come fix the light. i didn't even get housekeeping my entire stay there. i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone in the area, hopefully it will make them get their act together.

"this might be a classy looking hotel in downtown chicago, and while the location is not bad, the rooms are definitely hit or miss. they range from the super basic ""affordable"" room to the presidential and huge suites that only presidents could probably even afford. with so many different room options, it's no wonder they have difficulty honoring your exact reservation if you check-in past 4:00 pm. the hotel has a decent pool, but the health club is extra per day, as are many other services at the hotel. you'd imagine that for the price of a stay here ($160 up to multiple hundreds) that more things would be included! additionally, the check-in staff was a bit snobby and unhelpful. i really would expect great service for the high price of a stay here. if i were to return to chicago again, i'd definitely try out staying somewhere else.

"after a my stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago i contemplated the the poor quality of my experienc there and felt the need to document it. while the amenities were plush, the service of the staff was lacking. upon check in, my reservation was ""lost"" and it took over 30 minutes for the manager to make arraingments for my stay. there was no offer to upgrade me or comp me in any way. room service did a poor job in cleaning my room and left wet towles in the bath room. a used coffee filter was left in the coffee pot for me to clean out. i am not sure my sheets were changed out. when i checked out, the bell hop dropped my laptop and destroyed my hard drive leaving me to scramble to recover the report i spent days creating. overall my negative experience has left me wondering if they train thier staff on the proper way to attend to their customers. i will be relunctant to stay with them again until i am assured they have focused on trainging their staff better.

"i stayed in the homewood suites in downtown chicago last week, and i was extremely disappointed with my experience. the breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked. i came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted. also, the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm, having been kept out on the counter. i would have been better off bringing my own food! also, the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward. i had to move the furniture around to be able to watch tv, and then move it back before i could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways. i could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed. it just wasn't what i would expect from a hilton-brand hotel suite.

"while staying at the swissotel chicago i experienced some of the worst customer service i have at any hotel. the front desk was extremely rude while checking out, and even seemed to try to hurry us out. the fitness center was always packed and i was never able to get on any of the machines, as was the pool area. while eating at the restaurant, i felt it was a very overpriced meal, but it was very elegant looking. the last issue i had with the hotel was the valet parking, it took them awhile to get my car, and they actually pulled the wrong car around. it was another 10 minutes while i waited for them to sort the issue out. the worst part by far was the customer service, and although the hotel looked nice, it wasn't worth the stay with the way i felt i was treated based on the money i was spending. next time we are in chicago, we will be staying somewhere else!

"i booked my room at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers somewhat reluctantly; i was not enthusiastic about spending over $200 on this room after seeing the lackluster photos on their website. i was pleasantly surprised when i arrived that the lobby did not look as stuffy as it did online. unfortunately, my hopes were dashed once again when i arrived at my room. i say 'at' because after discovering my newly issued key was not working, i had to wait ten minutes before someone finally came to let me in. the room was painfully small-- if i didn't know better i would have thought i was staying at a red roof inn! the ""sweet sleeper bed"" had stiff and scratchy sheets, with a cheap-motel-thin coverlet. the disappointment continued after i entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke, but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible. i stayed my two nights, and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room (for which i was not responsible), charged on demand movies, an empty mini bar, and for smoking in the bathroom. hah! i have stopped payment on my credit card, and most certainly will not be submitting myself to this horrific experience again.

"i had such high hopes when i booked a stay at the knickerbocker hotel in chicago a few short weeks ago. when i arrived i should have known things would not be as i expected them to be. the host at the desk was rude and seemed put out that i was there. when i finally got checked in and arrived in my room i found that the temperature in the room was far too hot. the air conditioner was not turned on and on a hot, muggy day it would have been nice to enter into a cool room. i turned on the air conditioner and after quite some time the room cooled down. since i arrived in the early afternoon i decided to order room service from the nix restaurant that is in the hotel, i ordered the gooey triple decker grilled cheese, at $14 i was expecting the best grilled cheese sandwich i had ever eaten. when it finally arrived, more than an hour later, it was cold and the cheese was far from gooey! it also comes with a bowl of tomato bisque soup which, needless to say was also cold. for the quality of the food, $14 was way too much to pay for this meal. after a meeting with clients we stopped by the martini bar for drinks. the waitress was rude and seemed to be overwhelmed by the amount of people she had to serve. needless to say it took forever to get our drinks. we heard other patrons grumbling about the amount of time it took for the drinks to arrive as well. finally we got our drinks, we all ordered a french martini. we all took a drink and immediately all our mouths puckered, it had far too much pineapple juice in it making it very, very tart. at $14 each you would think it would be made to perfection, far from it. the evening finally over i went back to my room where i now found the temperature to be too cold due to the air conditioner not turning itself off when it should have. after a miserable night i checked out glad to be done with the knickerbocker hotel!

"worst high priced hotel i've ever stayed at! i had a business meeting in chicago and heard good reviews from a few co-workers thought it would be a nice place to stay but was a little upset with my experience with swissotel in chicago.front desk clerk was very rude at check in, valet parking was great until they brought my suv around front with a quarter size dent in the passenger size door, the hotel refused to pay for the damages. the room was very beautiful besides the faint mildew smell in the room. room service was great and very pleasing!our business meeting took place in the st gallen room where our meeting took a little disruptive turn, there was construction going on during that time and was very hard to hear the announcer in our meeting. other than that the hotel was beautiful but the stay wasn't as great as i expected, you may want to book somewhere else if you have a business meeting to attend in chicago.

"this place was absolutely foul. from the minute i walked in, i knew making a reservation here was a mistake. the person at the counter would barely make eye contact with me and acted like i was asking a huge favor of them in order to check in. the room we requested (a room with double beds) was not available. they told me that when i made the reservation, requesting double beds was a ""request"" and not a ""guarantee."" what's the point of making a reservation, then? when we got to the room, the room was totally gross. the decor was dated, the carpet was torn in spots and the whole place smelled musty and almost moldy. the bathroom had spots and stains all over it. i hesitate to think of the true cleanliness of the sheets. the ""complimentary"" fitness area was a joke. one broken treadmill and a couple of mismatched dumbbells. thanks but no thanks. we will definitely not return.

"i recently stayed at the swissotel chicago with my husband and two children. while the room was comfortable, i did not think that it was the best choice of hotel for those with children. the main reason for this was the dining. while the in house restaurants had children's options, there were not any other dining options that were a bit more informal. anyone with children knows that you don't want to take them to a sit down restaurant at certain times. this was especially true since we were traveling. we arrived at the hotel with tired children in hand and wanted to eat a quick meal and then put them to bed. however, our only real options on location were these fancy restaurants. this was certainly not the most family friendly of options for a hotel with a kid friendly package.

"oh my goodness, this has got to be one of the worst places to stay in all of downtown chicago. it all went well enough checking in, but them went downhill. there was so much left to be desired. the biggest problem was a huge turd in the toilet, i kid you not! i guess the maid was rather busy that day or took a break and forgot about it, i just don't know. but for the prices they charge, this type of thing is unacceptable. most everything else about the actual room was as expected. the noise was a bit more than i'm used to though, but there was a convention of college age kids staying on the floor above us. so we asked to be moved to another room, they did get us in another room, but that took nearly 2 hours. the second room worked out well for us, but i won't be risking staying here again. plus the pool was not available, i really wish they would have mentioned that on their website, i was looking forward to it for days. all in all, it is a beautiful place in a wonderful location, but they need to work on their customer service before i'll reconsider staying at the homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown.

"homewood suites is a hilton group hotel located in downtown chicago. though close to many sights, when we visited there was extensive construction going on along michigan avenue, so every morning we were awakened right at 8 am to the sound of jackhammering and bulldozers. we reserved the basic suite. though we arrived at 5 pm, well past check-in time, our room was not ready for 30 minutes. the management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience. once the suite was ready, it was nice. but then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom. we were relocated to another room with apologies, but again, no offer of compensation for the trouble. once we were finally settled, the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer. the food was okay, but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point. the staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service. we though it was a good idea since we were already so tired. unfortunately, it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected. all in all we were disappointed with our experience at homewood suites. we understand there are problems that may arise but the fact that the management did nothing to make it up to us is unacceptable. i would not suggest this hotel to a friend visiting chicago.

"not worth the price! i had the unfortunate experience of staying in the hilton homewood suites in downtown chicago. i stayed there with my family while we were on vacation. i wish i would have saved my money and went somewhere else. with a hotel this expensive, you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way, like complimentary parking. not a chance. in addition to the $259 price tag, i also had to pay $30 for parking, per night. if i had stayed at the motel 6, parking would have been free. the staff there were not very nice at all. when i registered, the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time. she was very rude to me. perhaps she was having a bad day or something, but i doubt it. after i arrived in my room, my key card didn't work, and i had to go back downstairs to get it fixed (once again, interrupting her precious free time with some actual work). the rooms had some nice features, like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television. i didn't go on vacation to cook though. the television didn't get very many channels, and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies (of course). i tried logging into facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room, but the ""complimentary"" internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using. i get a better connection at starbucks. they offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast, but it's nothing to write home about. i've had better food at mcdonald's. the food was pretty cold, and the choices are very limited. traffic around the hotel was hideous. this hotel is downtown, and you can definitely tell. there are a bunch of one-way streets around, which makes getting in and out confusing. the room was pretty clean, but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges. if you're looking for a hotel in chicago, i'd say save some money and go somewhere else. i've had better stays at the best western and many other hotels that cost less.

"although the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago claims to be an affordable upscale hotel in the heart of chicago, it is somewhat expensive, starting at $200 per night. there are very few special discount rates available for the budget conscious traveler. the rooms are modern looking and a little less cozy than one might prefer. the carpeting in the rooms is a little outdated and somewhat dirty in a few areas. the views from the rooms are not as great as they could be. the hotel seems to be understaffed and the heating unit in the room is hard to adjust to the right temperature. although the hotel is located on chicago's famous michigan avenue, it is a $40 taxi ride from o'hare airport and a $36 taxi ride from midway airport, both rather pricey options. if you chose to drive there, the valet parking charge is a hefty $53. again, not very budget friendly. all in all, even though the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago is close to some of the major chicago attractions, it is only an average hotel on many levels.

"i recently stayed at the hyatt regency chicago hotel, in downtown chicago. during my three days there i experienced the worst service of my life! we made reservations before-hand and upon arrival our room was already booked. it took us nearly two hours to actually get into our room (after being given the wrong key!). when we entered the room, the sheets were stained with what seemed to be cherry kool-aid. i am going to assume that it wasn't. after a night on the town we were bummed for money by three homeless men outside the hotel. after arriving in our room and hoping for a nice hot shower, we found a note on our door with a ""sorry"" note explaining they didn't have any hot water. early the next morning we were awoken by housekeeping (we had a dnd sign on our door). so we decided to wake up and go out for breakfast. comes to find out our car was broken into in their parking garage. we filed a police report and the police asked the managers for a video of the surveillance. unfortunately for us their surveillance was out of memory to record anymore. needless to say we left early the next day and i will never return to such a dreadful hotel ever again.

"i recently stayed at the hyatt regency in chicago, il, and boy was i surprised. the hotel looks nice from the outside but the smell from the river is noxious. in fact, the smell was so bad one night that it almost made it difficult to sleep or even think of eating. as if this were not enough, the bathroom of my room looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month and their were stains on the ""fresh"" towels. towards the end of my stay i saw a mouse on the ground floor and could only imagine what other critters may be lurking in the walls.

"the hyatt regency chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like they're staying in a nice hotel as soon as they enter the lobby. in other words, come here for the looks, not the amenities. they make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special de-germifying process.... you know, because a simple washing machine just isn't good enough. to me, this sort of thing appeals to folks who enjoy being picky and narcissistic because they identify these traits with being ""rich""--which most of them are not. meanwhile, the hotel doesn't even offer free wireless--an essential feature for business travelers like me. obviously i'm not the intended consumer, though, so i guess i shouldn't be surprised.

"my husband and i recently stayed at the conrad chicago for three nights, a thursday through saturday. let me say we were less than pleased with our experience. we chose to stay in the ""king bed deluxe room"" and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly, the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. the room was size was average, and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. the major annoyance was how loud people were. we came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. that is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. you can expect a loud guest maybe once, but every night is ridiculous. the service was also extremely sub par. we had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. one day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. she completely disregarded the sign, did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. it scared me and i'm just glad i was not getting out of the shower or changing. so to sum up, we will never stay at the conrad again, we will never recommend it to anyone else, and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in chicago.

"advertised as a luxury hotel the conrad chicago is more gouge than grand. my wife and i decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in chicago for our tenth anniversary. after looking at several hotels in the ""magnificent mile"" territory of downtown chicago we selected the conrad. the conrad's website impressed us immediately. the pictures of the rooms were lovely, they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions, not that we were planning to watch much tv. we called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system, i was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn't figure out how i was unable to make my reservations via the automated system. in any case i picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid september. my wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online, most impressed with the view. it cost a pretty penny, more than i would normally spend on out of town accomidations, but her happiness was worth it. unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the conrad. valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife's purse when unloading the luggage. we spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it. at the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system. i explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost. by the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay. that ended when we found out that our ""view"" was of a back alley service corridor. so much for the skyline. overall, the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow. i hate to be picky but i was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up. the spa had very limited hours as well. somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams, away from the hotel. it was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count. i would not recommend the conrad chicago. i would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in chicago. i was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms, but wouldn't have cleaned out so much of my wallet.

"i recently had the opportunity to stay at the conrad chicago hotel, located on north rush street. as part of the hilton hotel chain, i was confident that i would have a positive experience. unfortunately, from the time i walked in the door until the time i checked out, i was plagued with nothing but problems. when i walked into the hotel, i was not greeted by the concierge, which is usually a bad sign. (he was reading a newspaper.) then, when i announced that i was holding a reservation, they desk clerk was unable to find it. i had a confirmation number which they agreed matched a number in their system, but they could not find the room i had reserved. finally, they assigned me a room, but it was smaller than i had originally requested and it had a bad odor. i was very disappointed with the room and its decor. the room smelled of stale smoke, even though it was on a non-smoking floor. the bedspread was threadbare and there was no soap in the bathroom. i had to keep checking to make sure i was really at the conrad chicago. surely, this was not the way the hilton chain operates! there continued to be problem throughout my stay. i asked for a wake-up call and it was 15 minutes late, which had me scurrying around so i could make my business meeting. i ordered breakfast to be brought to my room, and it never showed up -- at all! and the water for my shower never reached anything by lukewarm, so my shower was short and unsatisfying. i decided to check out of the conrad chicago a day earlier than originally planned because i was so dissatisfied with the hotel and the way it attempted to resolve the problems and issues. upon my return home, i wrote a letter to the hotel manager, but never received a reply. because they refused to acknowledge that i had problems, i will not be staying at the conrad chicago again, and will avoid all hilton hotels in the future.

"what a disappointment this hotel was. first, the checkin desk was understaffed and we had to wait forever to get through the line to check in. when we finally got up to our room, we opened the door and found someone else was already in it! yes, the front desk clerk actually checked us into an occupied room and basically gave us a key to someone else's room. we went back to the clerk who checked us in (skipping the still present line, which got us annoyed stares from the other people waiting) and told him the problem. however, he was already helping another guest checkin and made us wait until he was done with that person before helping us. he did apologize for the mix up and then went into the back room to find out what to do. this took a *very* long time. it was a good 10-15 minutes until he came back. he said there were no more rooms available of the type we had booked and the only ones they had left were on a lower floor with no view. the hotel offered us a discount off the regular price for these, but when we got to this new room, we found out why these rooms hadn't been taken. the room was overlooking the loading dock at the back of the hotel. we briefly considered just leaving and going to another hotel, but it was late already so we just decided to make do. that was, of course, until the garbage truck came around 6am and made all sorts of noise picking up the dumpsters and dropping them back down. then somewhere around 7:30am the delivery trucks started showing up making that beep-beep backup sound and all sorts of other noise. so much for a good night's sleep. i suppose i should say the room itself looked nice, but with all the noise from the loading dock, who cares. we gave up and checked out that morning to find another hotel. definitely not going back here ever again.

"chicago has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers. when visiting the windy city, however, the conrad hotel and resort is one to avoid. while the description promises clean accommodations, luxury amenities, and ""deep soaking tubs,"" in relity, the rooms fall short of expectations. i opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet. a bit disappointed, i decided to ignore this fact. hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels, i made my way to the bathroom. while i did find a large, deep bathtub, there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look. hardly what i expected for the price i paid for the accommodations. in the corner of the bathroom, i found a reminder of a pevious guest, a clump of blond hair. the maid service seemed to be lacking. not to be deterred from enjoying my stay, i decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen i had been promised. unfortunately, the battery to the remote control was dead. i called the front desk, at my wits' end, to complain about the issues, but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word. overall, i would definitely not recommend the conrad hotel and resort in chicago. my room was dirty, the staff was unfriendly, and the ammenities were few and far between. on my next stay in chicago, i will definitely stay elsewhere.

"i recently stayed at the omni chicago hotel and it was awful. when i arrived my room was not ready. two hours later when it was finally cleaned, i entered and saw they they had not brought the cot that i had requested for my son. i asked for it again, but they never brought it. my mattress was uncomfortable, and i did not like sharing it with my son. the ac did not even work and it was terribly hot in the room. the next morning we ate the continental breakfast before leaving, and it too was bad. there was cereal, low quality yogurt, and burnt flavorless muffins. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

"i just got home from my stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel. me and my family were in chacago for the the week and this hotel was the closest to where we needed to be. when we walked in the door there was a horrid odor. almost like a public bathroom. the check in clerk was very irritable and was very uncooperative. she would not let us go to our rooms because our entire family was not there yet! when we finally got to our rooms the beds were not made and the room was uninviting. the beds felt like we were sleeping on rocks. after the first dreadful night we got up and went downstairs to eat breakfast. the food there tastes and looks like vomit. the rest of the weeks stay there was like living in hell. the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel is definitely not a good place to stay. it is actually probably on of the worst hotels i've ever stayed at.

"i recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel, and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that i ever had. one of the main reasons why i had originally booked my stay at the fairmont was because the property offered special, ""pure"" rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic. because i suffer from extreme allergies -- and i really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- i was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities. i'll tell you this right now -- save your money. when i got to my room, i immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold. to add to the gross factor, i took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet. the comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it. there was no way i was going to stay in this room, so i made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room. the woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer. after making me wait for another twenty minutes, she finally informed me that they could put me in another room, but it would be a four hour wait. four hours! it was absolutely ridiculous. no hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way. i do not recommend the fairmont nor will i ever stay there again.

"this hotel is rather far from the airport and in traffic it took almost 2 hours to get there. by that time, i was so tired i was just ready to check in to my room. i stood in line forever as there was only one person working at the front desk. that was only the beginning. it was very noisy outside from people constantly walking around. i guess it's because they're located in the middle of the downtown area, but they could at least make the walls thicker. i don't want to hear everything going on in my neighbor's room. the bathroom was not very clean and one of the towels had a hole in it. the toilet ran all night which kept me up along with all the people on the street. the restaurant food was horrible and i would rather buy food from a street vendor than to pay the ridiculously high price they charged for a burger. overall, i was very disappointed with my stay at the conrad chicago.

"the name conrad (the most luxurious of all hilton hotels) should illicit nothing but images of pure elegance and luxury; however, the conrad in chicago, il did obviously not receive the memo. upon entering the hotel, we were not greeted by any of the hotel staff. additionally, we were not offered any help. the desk receptionist was beyond rude. her snide remarks towards my wife and me set the tone for a the rest of our stay. after getting our card, we were finally offered help with our luggage. the young man who helped us could barely handle our luggage. strangely, he somehow found more strength when it was time to collect his tip. he received the tip he deserved, which he scoffed about and groaned under his breath as he walked away. upon first looking at the room it was beautiful. however, closer inspection revealed that the room had not been cleaned since the last visitor had left. there was hair in the sink and around the toilet. there was even a used bar of soap in the bathtub. this fact was not met with any apology by hotel staff. instead, i was told that was preposterous and that the room had indeed been cleaned to the highest of standards. two-hours later, someone came into the room to ""investigate"". when they saw the mess that had been left, they offered a menial apology. still another two hours later, housekeeping arrived. the level of incompetence even extended to the valets in the parking garage. in the most incredible display of stupidity of our visit, the valet actually brought the wrong car to me. i was half tempted to take the car that was brought to me (it was certainly an incredible make and model), but my better judgment prevailed. i informed the valet of his mistake, to which he replied, ""sorry dude, i read your ticket wrong."" i know that he did not smoke in my car, but he smelled so strongly of smoke, that the smell melted into my seat. luckily, its location on rush will help get out of the terror that is conrad chicago. there are so many better hotels in chicago -- please spend your money elsewhere.

"the fairmont chicago millennium park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels i have stayed at in a while. at almost $500 a night, one would expect. traveling with my wife, i expected to pay the cost of the room, already being outrageous, but then i was hit with another $20 charge for her to stay. even with a king bed, they only figure in one person to their cost. the beds were average and although there was much to do, everything cost an arm or a leg. it was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away. all in all for the amount of money that i was paying on a per night basis, if i was in chicago for any longer than that one night, i definitely would have stayed somewhere else. i guess you live and you learn, its just a shame that i had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations.

"during my latest business trip, both me and my wife recently stayed at the omni chicago hotel in chicago,illinois, at one of their deluxe suites. unfortunately, and i think i speak for both of us, we were not fully satisfied with the hotel. the hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations, and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures, the service is certainly sub-par. when one plans a stay at such an establishment, they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in. first of all, the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on, the air coming out seemed musty. second of all, the fitness center was only open until 10:30 pm. for people who like to exercise after dinner, this can certainly be a problem. especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight. for these, as well as other similar reasons, i would not recommend this hotel, if one is looking for luxury accommodations.

"my experience with the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel was terrible! i arrived exactly at my check in time only to be told my room would not be ready for another hour. i chose to wait patiently at the hotel bar and found myself again disappointed i sat for 15 minutes before the bar tender served me and the drink i received was warm. when the room was finally ready i was horrified to find hairs in the bathtub and mysterious spots on the bedding. when i called down to housekeeping the staff was very rude and maid who they sent up to change my sheets acted annoyed and muttered under her breath the whole time she was changing our sheets and cleaning the bathroom. after all this hassle i would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered i found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee 13.95 for a 24 hour period. i was shocked having stayed at a variety of higher end hotels i have never once been asked to pay extra for my wifi access. overall i was highly disappointed with my stay and will not be returning to the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel any time soon.

"did not enjoy my stay at the omni chicago hotel. firstly, the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful. there was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle. secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out, the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees. considering i paid well over $250 per night for the romance package reservation, it was below my standards and i will not be heading back to the omni chicago hotel any time soon.

"my stay at the hyatt regency was an experience that i'll never ever forget - not in a good way. check-in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant. i went up to my room and looked around, all seemed ok at first. i was bushed so i flopped on the bed... ohhhhh noooooo! the bed was as hard as a military bunk from my army days. but i was so tired that i just passed out. of course i woke up with a back ache...great. i figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so i plugged the tub, turned the hot water on full force, and poured in some shower gel. i put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm. i called the front desk but they were no help, the clerk just apologized. frustrated at this point, i turned on the tv and switched on the air. i put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and i saw something slimy inside of the vent. it looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something. i couldn't take anymore of this. i went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk. it seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized, no empathy as if he's used to hearing about the goop in the ac. he offered me a free night but there is no way that i'd stay at this place again - ever.

"stay away from the hyatt regency chicago. i recently had to spend the weekend in chicago on business, and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town, but alas, i was left disappointed. i arrived in the afternoon, my flight having been delayed, ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening. unfortunately, my room was not ready. it should have been ready hours earlier, but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff. in any event, i was advised to wait in the bar, creatively named big bar. they seemed annoyed that i wanted only water, not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that i spent time in their hideously noisy establishment--i wanted only to relax in my room. i waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk. was my room ready yet? 'what room?' they replied. to my astonishment, it seemed that i no longer had a reservation! how this came to pass, i do not know, and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me. i explained that i was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned, or furnished, or renovated, or whatever they were doing to make it ready, but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer, who spake ""guest not found"" or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters. i requested the manager, who was unavailable, presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either. finally, i admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel, with fewer regrets than i would have imagined, to find a better place to spend the night--a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point. as it was, i found another hotel, better priced, better staffed, and with rooms ready for my custom. so if you are looking an experience like no other, book a room at the hyatt regency chicago. if you want a place to sleep, look elsewhere.

"after staying at the omni chicago hotel recently, i was nothing but disappointed. this ""luxury hotel"" obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable. when i arrived, my hotel room was devoid of towels, and after calling down to the front desk, it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered. on top of that, when i went to connect to the internet in my room, the wifi signal was too weak and i was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop! for the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their ""superior corner suite"", i could have stayed a week at a holiday inn, and after this stay, i wish i had.

"my husband and i were really looking forward to spending our anniversary at the conrad hotel. for the price we were paying we were expecting a luxurious hotel with all the amenities unfortunately it was quite the opposite. upon arriving we were greeted by a rude and incompetent receptionist. not only could she not find our reservation due to the fact that she kept misspelling our name, but she refused to apologize when she finally did find them and acted as if it was our fault she couldn't spell! our room turned out to be okay except for the stain on my pillow case which ruined the experience for me. we ate at the restaurant on site and were less than impressed with the food. it was alright but nothing out of this world. we felt we could have gotten a better meal elsewhere. all in all the conrad was a big disappointment to both of us.

"my stay at the fairmont chicago millennium hotel was a short one; although, it was intended to be for five days, it only last two. when me and my husband arrived we were met by a valet who knicked our mercedez. the clerk/concierge was on his phone for nearly 5 full minutes before he noticed that we were standing in front of him. when we checked in, we lugged all of our luggage upstairs to our room to find that someone was already in it. we then returned to lobby, and to our dismay, the hotel had double booked the room! after another 30 minutes of haggling and whatnot we were able to be moved to a ""better"" room. the bed was unbearable, the shower looked like it hadnt been cleaned properly and the room smelled of cigarrettes (although it was supposedly a non-smoking room). too tired and jet lagged to complain we went to sleep. however, it was hard for us to do so because voices could be heard all thoughout the night due to the paper thin walls of the room. i needed an ambien to go to sleep. i woke up with backaches, the continental breakfast had me in the bathroom most of the day, and the maids conveniently forgot to clean our room. me and my husband had had enough and decided to go to the hyatt.

"on a recent business trip to chicago, i had the unfortunate circumstance of staying at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel. upon entrance, the lobby is beautiful and the hotel seems very nice. however, as i approached the check in counter, the woman working there was very terse and rude to me. they had me booked in the wrong kind of room and when i asked about changing it, i was snubbed and made to feel like it was a tremendous imposition for them to accommodate me. after a half hour, i finally received the correct room. the linens on the bed were of a very cheap quality, they were scratchy and had a musty smell. also, the bathroom wasn't cleaned properly as there was still trash in the waste basket (including a condom) and there was no shampoo. also, i had a coffee pot in the room but no coffee. when i called the front desk to ask for some, they told be it was not free and would i like to charge the coffee to my account. i found this hotel to be shocking and highly recommend that no one stay there.

"after staying at the omni chicago hotel, i can honestly say that i will take the time to book a room, ahead of time, on my next visit to chicago. we were thrilled to see how beautiful the hotel was, at first because it seemed like it would be a nice place. the outside of the hotel was pristine, but our room was filthy! we requested a non-smoking room, but it had obviously been smoked in before, as you could still smell the stale smoke in the air. in fact, we were told that the entire hotel was supposed to be non-smoking, but the hallway smelled like cigarettes as well. to top it off, room service brought us the wrong item. when we checked out, we saw that they still tried to chage us for the item, even after we sent it back. i would also have to point out that michigan avenue is a bad spot for a hotel that claims to be so high class. right outside of our hotel were drug dealers and prostitutes. i couldn't even go to the gas station after 8 p.m. because i was too scared to leave the hotel. the pool was closed on our first night there because of some convention that the hotel was holding, thus keeping us from using the hot tub that we were looking forward to. for the price of the room i would say this place was a definite disappointment. i have learned my lesson to check out the room before i agree to stay in it next time. this place gets 1/2 of a star from me.

"i was really excited to be visiting chicago for the first time, and the hotel that was recommended to me was the conrad chicago, located on rush street. i wanted a hotel that was conveniently located to all the downtown sites, and the conrad chicago does not disappoint in that respect. however, everything else about this hotel could be classified as sub-par, ranging from the rudeness of the check-in clerks to the roaches that were freely roaming in my room. this hotel does not deserve to be on anyone's recommended list. my first problem was a rude desk clerk who checked me in. after asking for three forms of identification (most places only ask for a driver's license) and asking me twenty questions about the reason for my trip to chicago, she reluctantly gave me a room key. i asked if there was a bell cap to help me with my bags and she said if i wanted to wait, one would be able to help in about 15 minutes. i didn't feel like waiting, so i dragged my bags to the room, only to find that the room key did not work! instead of dragging everything back down, i decided to use my cell phone to call the front desk, only there was no cell phone signal in the hall way. i couldn't believe i was in the middle of downtown chicago and the hotel did not have a signal! i finally flagged down someone from the housekeeping staff to let me into my room, but i immediately saw there were problems. two roaches scampered across the carpet and when i went into the bathroom, there were no towels or wash cloths. i went to turn on the tv and it didn't work. one of the lamps was missing a light bulb. i couldn't believe that this was happening to me. i was at the conrad chicago, not the motel six! i then sat down on the bed and the mattress was soft and lumpy. i was ready to cry. i was spending a lot of money on this hotel and it was a dump. i called down to the front desk and asked for another room, but they refused, saying i had gotten a special rate and it did not allow room changes. i insisted that they give me towels, fix the tv, put a light bulb in the lamp and have someone spray to get rid of the roaches. they agreed, but told me it would take ""awhile"" because several of their key personnel had called in sick. my stay at the conrad chicago was a nightmare from beginning to end. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone

"i was really looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation, but unfortunately that was not to be had. from the moment we arrived at the omni, the staff was belligerent and extremely rude. they had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before. if we weren't so tired, we would've gone to a different hotel right then, but hindsight is 20/20. after we finally got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby, we decided to go down to the pool, which was tiny and kind of dirty, so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing. the internet access was really slow. i will never stay here again. save yourself the headache and book somewhere else!

"i have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel. the omni chicago's age shows, and not in a ""great ambiance"" way! the rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking. i say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor, almost like mildew, that permeated the first room we were given. seriously, it brought tears to my eyes! the staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma, but finally agreed to switch us to another room. the new one didn't smell, but was clearly past its prime. housekeeping was almost nonexistent. we had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels. how can you forget to leave towels for the guests? i'm not one to complain, but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here, we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment. we received neither and will not be returning to the omni chicago.

"recently staying at the omni chicago hotel, was a waste of money. the rooms are typical standard rooms,(unless you want to pay an unreasonable amount for one of the premier rooms), the service from the staff was nothing to rave about unless, your ideal, idea of service is waiting in the lobby for 40 minutes waiting for anybody to help you carry your heavy luggage up to your room. sorry to say in short i think my money would have been better spent staying at a hojo's.

"me and my wife stayed at the omni hotel in chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital. we ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here. at first once coming into the room, there was a mildewy smell in the air, which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase. the continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. the eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all. to make matters even worse, the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon, when my wife was back from exploring the city. this was simply unacceptable by any standard.

"whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas. most notably is cleanliness, as although the lobby was very clean, the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not. dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways, and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time. the furnishings were nice and modern, but with various blemishes upon close inspection. bathroom was relatively clean, with the exception of the shower. view was nice for this particular room, and service was relatively quick. the food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue. this time with the glasses which were stained, the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel. i will not make the mistake of staying here again.

"i stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in chicago for 3 nights. i must say, i was not impressed. this is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill. to start with, the hotel lobby was totally gaudy. it had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and i guess was supposed to give an air of style. the room was ok i suppose, but certainly not worth the premium price i paid for it. the hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing french cuisine, but the food, while arranged nicely, tasted unremarkable and again, was overpriced. my final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible. it is simply not worth it.

"the hotel sofitel chicago water tower bills itself as a 4-star luxury hotel, but the luxury is evidently in the eye of the beholder. filled with trite modern art and modular, cheap-looking furniture that looks straight out of the latest ikea catalogue, this 32-floor hunk of glass has to be one of the ugliest hotels i have ever seen. ""urban chic"" design does not equal comfort; the seating and bed furniture are made more for the design floor than for actual use. room service is expensive, slow, and the food you eventually do get is mediocre in quality and flavor. the hotel features two bars: the cafe des architectes bar, and the simply named le bar. cutesy french names and trendy modern outfittings do not a good hotel bar make! excellent service, fair prices, friendly and competent staff are what make a bar great, none of which you will find at either of these bars. cafe des architectes is also a restaurant, offering ""seasonal menus featuring contemporary cuisine with french roots,"" which means small portions and large prices at questionable quality. even the old standby filet mignon did not stand up to its reputation, coming out a little dry hunk of meat rather than a succulent steak. pass this one by, if you're looking for a comfortable, enjoyable stay in downtown chicago. the water tower is dry.

"the sofitel chicago water tower, while seemingly a good idea in theory, has many drawbacks. at first glance, it appears quite luxurious and grand, but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked. the hotel is quite tall, coming in at 32 stories, and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying. the staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest, so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed. the hotel tries to adopt a french flavor, but its efforts fall short. the only real french influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars. the hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city, but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment. the same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general. the city's traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one's stay here. overall, i would not recommend this hotel. make a different choice.

"my wife and i recently stayed at the hotel monaco in chicago and, after our experience there, we will not be returning. with a hotel that markets itself as ""luxury,"" we were expecting to get a big bang for our buck. we were disappointed, to say the least. first of all, we stayed in the king deluxe room and it was uncomfortably small. the space was used poorly - my wife and i could not walk around the bed at the same time because there was so little space. the decor seemed rather dated and not of the best quality. although they said our room woudl be ready at 3, we had to wait almost an hour past that for our room to be ready. although the staff did offer a complimentary drink as an apology, they didn't seem terribly upset or apologetic about the inconvenience this caused. the noise at night from the city is horrible - even with the radio on in our room we could hear traffic and pedestrians on the street well past midnight. the hotel would not move us to a different room. all in all, i felt that we paid $100.00 for a luxury hotel and got a $40 motel 6. we will definitely not be back anytime soon.

"i was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the james. i had heard from others that it was ""agreeable"" and ""workable"" and ""all right,"" or even ""a nice place."" i figured that there would be no problems and booked a guestroom for a long weekend visit with my long-distance girlfriend. according to the website, i was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cutting-edge contemporary furnishings and ""warm tones."" well, when i arrived, i felt like i was in an ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day. everything in the front was just a bit too askew. the staff were busy, distracted, inattentive, and in every way keen to show me i was a bother to them. i handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort. i also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price. it looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before i got there. the bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly, inexplicably, of men's cologne. nobody cared when i complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just ""stuck in my nose"" and that it would go away. well, it didn't, and i had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived. this ruined my entire first evening in chicago. for my price i could have stayed a week at an economy hotel, gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs, and still saved money. and i would not have been treated like such a pest. needless to say, i will be looking elsewhere when i go back to chicago. i may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels, but i know when i am wasting my money.

"when i went to the james hotel in chicago i truly expected a luxury experience exactly like what they were advertising. gorgeous chairs, staff at the desk focusing on their job, and a clean, well decorated hotel room. much to my, and my wallet's dismay i found quite the opposite. i arrived to the hotel late after my flight was delayed, and found the clerk reading a magazine. it must have been a fascinating article, as it took him a full minute to look up and ask if i had a reservation, or would be making one. i said i had one, and gave him the voucher i'd printed out. he checked it, and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out, he went on to say that i would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if i wished to stay the night. i grudgingly accepted the two person option as the jet lag was setting in and i desperately needed to get some sleep. the clerk offered to walk me to my room, saying i looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after i got some sleep. i accepted, and followed him to my new room. he carried the briefcase i had with me, but it was not apparent why at the time as i had both hands free. he ushered me into my room, setting the briefcase down inside, and said if i needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything. i thanked him and closed the door. it was then that i looked around and fully saw where i was staying. what was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6"" apart, covered in ruffled blankets and sheets. the cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently. a quick look around the other areas and i found the bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap, not even the complementary ones were left behind. i got ready for bed, and looked around for the tv remote, which it turned out, had no batteries in it. instead, i just turned out the lights and rolled over, sheets and blanket turned inside out to try and find a cleaner option. in the morning i walked down to the lobby and asked to check out. i'd had enough of the hotel after one night. the clerk that morning was a cheerful blond who cheerfully asked me my room number and handed me a bill. $240 for my room, and an extra $80 with a note about a baggage service. i asked her about it, and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service. i asked if it was considered reasonable to charge $80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up, and riding the elevator, and she said it was unusual, but not unheard of. she offered to change it to a ""mere"" $20 and handed me a slip with a phone number, name, and reason for the disagreement, saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and i after i signed it. i did so, and left, my wallet $260 lighter, and my head throbbing with a headache from lack of sleep.

"for a hotel rated with four diamonds by aaa, one would think the hilton chicago would be almost like staying at a palace with royalty. the only royal thing about this hotel however is that it was a royal nightmare. i should have known from the moment i walked in with my wife that this was going to become a bigger headache than what it was worth. first off, as soon as we arrived to check in at the hotel with the clerk who couldn't be any older than nineteen or twenty, red flags started going up. the clerk was extremely rude and lazy, acting like it was a chore even getting up from texting on his cell phone. if that wasn't bad enough, the clerk pretty much ignored me while blatantly staring at my wife's breasts. she wasn't even wearing anything that could be considered skimpy as it was cold out and she was wearing a turtle neck sweater under a large fur lined coat. after diverting his atention several times we finally got our room keys. it shouldn't have been any surprise when we learned that there were no one to help us with our luggage as the clerk said they were all out on break. okay, that was annoying, but we managed easy enough. we finally got to the third floor where our suite had been reserved for over a month and we looked forward to resting after our long trip. to our surprise, not to mention our disgust and horror, their was already a couple in what was supposed to be our room on the bed making out. it took almost a half hour between the couple in the room, the front desk, and my wife and me to get it straightened out. apparently the night clerk didn't bother following policy as they had taken our reservation off the computer to give to their friends while leaving the printed card for the day clerk. after what could only be described as chaos, we were finally given another room on the next floor up. we were thankful when we got to it and my wife went to use the bathroom while i dropped our luggage by the beds. hearing a clinking sound i bent down to look what one of the bags could have hit to see an empty beer bottle sticking out from under the bed. i was about to call back down to give the clerk a piece of my mind when i heard my wife cry out. there on the wall of the bathroom were several roaches crawling around and i noticed something else in the sink that almost made us leave then and there. there, in the sink and in very plain sight, was a used condom! so far we were less than thrilled about being there and we stomred back downstairs and demanded our money back. by then the desk manager had returned from where ever she went off to and talked us into taking another room, free of charge to make up for our troubles. the room itself was thankfully clean with no bugs and no trash or any other disgusting items laying around. despite being a lot smaller and not having the promised view that our other room should have had, we decided to make due. so while my wife went to get cleaned up after our long trip i pulled my laptop out to use the so called high speed internet access. i shouldn't have even bothered as i've used dial up that went at least three times as fast as the speeds i was getting. with a quick call to the desk i was informed the person responsible for the internet was gone for the day and there was nothing that could be done for the moment. so instead of worrying about it, we went to get something to eat from the the onsite dinning area. yet again we were met with rude people who either stared at my wife's chest or forgot half of our order. after arguing with them for what seemed like forever over not getting everything, we found that our found was not only bland, it was cold! we didn't even bother trying anything else, that was the final straw so we got our things and found another hotel. i don't know who would hire a bunch or rude employees who was barely out of high school or who couldn't clean a room, but i know that that hotel didn't deserve four diamonds unless it was in the negative. that place should be shut down because there is no way they know how to run a decent hotel.

"after staying at the james chicago last weekend i can honestly say i will be going for affordability on my next trip. the james chicago is terribly overpriced and the staff was very cold and disconnected. the chairs in the room looked like something out of ikea. i love chicago but this hotel is definitely not one of its better places to stay. i believe i would have been better off and happier staying at the holiday inn. you don't always get what you pay for.

"my family and i went to this hotel on holiday last month. it was a very bad hotel. when we got there we imediatly checked in and went up to our room. the view from the window was a brick wall. really? we even asked the lasy at the front desk, but she said they couldn't put us in a room with a view cause we didn't book one and we couldn't upgrade. also, my wife is a light sleeper and the trains kept her up at night. another thing is alot of ads boast a hot tub in all the rooms but this is not true, our room only had a normal tub. but, the tub had no stopper, so we could only take showers. the room was also very small compared to other hotels with around the same prices.

"my wife and i booked a room at the hilton chicago three weekends ago, as this is a downtown hotel and a well known brand we knew we were going to have to pay a little more but for that additional price we were expecting to get a quality hotel. we were expecting some minutia of luxury. however, this was not the case with the hilton chicago. first, we had reserved a room with a king size bed, but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed. now, we did get a reduced price because of this, but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked. second, we had to change our room key twice. the room keys they used supposedly lost their ""charge"". this is what the front desk told us. so, we had to go up to our room, find out the key didn't work, then come back down stairs get a new key, then get back in. this was highly unprofessional, and they really need to look into their key system. lastly, we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room. we knew this was accurate, but i always check just in case. but two weeks later when i checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card. i had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card. suffice it to say we will not be staying there again.

"a recent stay at the james hotel-chicago, revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only. although the rooms and public areas look nice, the hotel still needs serious work. our first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke. we asked for a new room which was clean and odor free. we had to involve the manager before our request was granted. the new room was better at first glance, but was severely lacking. we could not get the temperature properly regulated. the room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay. in a hotel commanding the rates of the james, we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted, not something which is a constant battle. our mattress was horribly uncomfortable. when the rooms were updated, the james skipped new mattresses. ours was worn to the point of having indentations you can't get out of--when you lie down, you sort of sink into a hole. this matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a 'luxury' hotel. last, but not least, we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay. in spite of the calming decor, the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night's sleep. all in all, we were unhappy with our accommodations at the james chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location. you will be happier almost anywhere else.

"the hotel was not one of the better ones i stayed at. the room was seemingly nice at first, but after staying there for a few days it seemed like the cleaning staff never came through to clean it. i had the same sheets for a three days before i called and requested they be changed. also, the walls seem to be paper thin and you can hear what is going on in the adjacent rooms, which interfered with my sleep. i ate at the primehouse in the restaurant also, and asked for a well done steak, and the steak was still pretty pink on the inside and lacked flavor. this is definitely not a hotel i would recommend to anyone.

"i wish to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at the sofitel chicago water tower. my husband and i had planned a trip to chicago for our tenth wedding anniversary. we had gone to great expense to fly his parents in from california so they could have time with their grandchildren. my husband and i had not gone on a honeymoon because he we got deployed to iraq the week after we got married. everyone was so excited! mark and i had reservations for one of the junior suites. we hadn't gone to chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered. unfortunately, when we got to our room, the view was disappointing. we had requested a non-smoking room and were assigned to one, but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there. i am asthmatic and became very ill. we asked to be moved to another room, but were told there were no other rooms (even downgrades) available. nothing was done to try to make up for this. because of my health, my husband and i checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend. this is not how i had imagined spending such a special time. now, when i think of my 10th anniversary, i will always have this memory to tarnish it.

"we booked this trip several months in advance and were greatly looking forward to our stay at the hotel monaco in chicago. however, our experience was significantly different from what we expected, for the following reasons. first of all, there was only one person at the front desk when we arrived. that person was preoccupied with something on their computer so our presence was not acknowledged for several minutes. then when we got to our room, there were beautiful drapes in the window and across one entire wall but i found them to be incredibly dusty. just bumping into them slightly caused a cloud of dust to emerge which i found distasteful. overall it was a good stay but those two inconveniences made us question the amount of money we paid for it.

"i recently stayed at the sofitel hotel (chicago water tower), and i was quite disappointed. i was excited by the great location (on east chestnut street downtown), but this was a mediocre hotel for the price ($250 per night before taxes). the view from my room was of the top of a parking garage and some dumpsters, and yes, the view of downtown in the distance was pretty, but i was very disappointed. the bedding seemed to be polyester, not the luxury cotton many lower-level hotels are featuring lately. when i ordered room service at 10:30 (on a thursday night), i had to wait for 55 minutes, 20 minutes longer than i was quoted. i ordered a salad, and i thought the lettuce was a bit limp as if it had been sitting out for too long. overall, i was very disappointed by my overpriced stay at the sofitel chicago water tower.

"when i first looked at the hotel monaco chicago - a kimpton hotel's website, the hotel looked very pleasing and a great place for me to stay during my visit to chicago. the problems began when i called to make a reservation. the woman who answered was very rude, to say the least. i had a few questions about the spa services. she rushed through what sounded like she was reading through a brochure. i decided that i shouldn't let one person ruin my experience with the hotel so i made a reservation and soon i was in chicago. the front desk service was very pleasant when i arrived, and the room seemed clean, other than the mysterious stain on my bedsheets. i got dressed up and went down to the bar area for a drink and appetizers. it took over thirty minutes for any worker to approach me for an order. yet two other parties that walked in after me were served right away. i was baffled considering i was dressed nice and in a fairly good mood considering it was my first trip to chicago. needless to say i will not be staying at this hotel again.

"upon first inspection, sofitel chicago water tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown chicago, but appearances can certainly be deceiving. best summed up, sofitel is nothing more than a fancy holiday inn. it certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain, even if it is an international one. the customer service is poor unless you look like you have $50 to tip someone. the furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from ikea. the rooms are dirty when you first walk in, the air feels stale, and the views are certainly all they're cracked up to be. none of this is worth a ""luxury"" price or even worthy of a ""luxury"" name. i will certainly not be staying here again.

"the hilton chicago, located on prime real estate in downtown chicago, has not aged as gracefully as other hotels around the country opened during the same period of time. the hotel does maintain the appearance of luxury that has made it iconic, but that luxury is not in accord with 21st century standards. lacking any form of fitness center, the hilton is almost alone among the major hotels of chicago in forcing its patrons to go elsewhere for a quick workout. even nominal fees for wireless internet use in hotel rooms is very rare at this point, and the outrageous parking fee of $43 for guests will discourage out of towners from making the hilton their destination. most guest rooms are no different than any other hilton anywhere, meaning that unless you are staying in the admittedly fantastic executive suites, you will be paying a premium for a prosaic hotel experience.

"i stayed at the hilton chicago during a recent business trip. i elected to go with their executive suite upgrade. all i can say is, ""what upgrade?"" it's barely anything above what you get normally. and for the price i paid, i was expecting much better acommodations. because i arrived around 10:30 the night i checked in (delayed flight) i did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10. i find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you're expecting a guest who has not checked in yet. beyond that, it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room. first it was a room mix-up, then it was a missing key card. that was extremely frustrating as i was tired and i had a presentation to give the next morning. speaking of the next morning, the complimentary breakfast was a joke. when i just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast, i'll stay at the next super 8 i find. and the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed. i will not be staying at the hilton chicago every again even though i frequent chicago. this tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot.

"james chicago would be one of the worst hotels i have ever been to in my life! even though i noticed that the design of the place was extremely artistic, its service quality and hotel conditions were horrible. they gave me a room in which the blankets were dirty and looked as if it been used just moments ago! i figured it was because the hotel was busy but i started to notice that the furniture came with a cost in service. the television was not working at all. i was extremely disapointed, especially when coming from a rigorous day of work and just wanting to relax. sadly, i settled in doing my work instead of frittering my time doing noting when i got the next disapointment. the wifi was a bust. absolutely nothing to do but to stare at the furniture or just stare at the wall. i am never going to james hotel ever again!

"i was initially excited when i found out that my employer was sending me to chicago on business, but i could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of the james chicago. when i arrived, my reservation could not be found in their system, although i had made it myself. after some words with the manager on duty, mr. chad montgomery, i was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate. anyone can make a mistake, so i wasn't too angry at that point. my room was bland and colorless, in spite of the james' boasts of their attention to design and detail. the room was mostly clean, but after seeing the stains on the bedding, i am not convinced that they were washed after the room's last occupant. i attended a stressful business meeting in the dining room that night, complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy, disgruntled waitstaff. afterward i decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order. i was assured that i would enjoy ""asha's purifying shower ritual"", which would primarily take place in my own room. the shower was okay, but i think i must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided, because i broke out in hives all over my body. next came the ""in-room"" portion. while i was in the shower, five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room. i guess they were supposed to make it smell good, but i began choking on the odor the minute i walked in the room. my masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion, but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking. i am sure certain areas are not on the massage menu. in closing, if you have ever considered staying at the james chicago, i beg of you to reconsider. with only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel, and a suitcase full of negative (including a pending court case against the masseuse), i can almost guarantee you would regret staying there. i know i do.

"i really wish i could say that i liked this hotel, but the whole experience was just plain awful. my first warning sign should have been when i made my reservation. the person i spoke with when placing my reservation had absolutely no idea what he was doing. at first he tried to book me into the wrong hotel, and then when we finally got it sorted which hotel i was actually wanting, he booked me for the wrong dates. he read me the right dates, and it was only when i called back two days later to confirm that i found out he'd given me the wrong dates. hilton did get it fixed, but i already had a bad feeling about my stay. then came actually staying at the hotel. the people at the check-in desk were downright rude. then there was the room. i was supposed to be in a non-smoking room, but the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. the hotel staff refused to believe me, but did let me change rooms to one that didn't smell of cigarettes. however, i might as well have stayed in the first room. i was short towels, and it took four calls(over a period of 12 hours) to the front desk to get some. the sheets had not been changed, made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them. yes, i was able to get fresh sheets, but like the towels, it took several hours for them to be delivered. since this is a pet friendly hotel, lucky me i got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs. the walls were so paper thin, all i could hear all night was barking. when i complained about it, the staff refused to believe me, and said that the walls of the room are so thick i shouldn't be able to hear anything from next door. yeah right. i was excited to use the pool, but just like my room, it hadn't been cleaned recently. then, i tried the fitness center. half the equipment was broken. i tried to cut my stay short, but of course this hotel wouldn't work with me at all. they even refused to comp my stay for all the grossness i had to deal with. i will never stay with hilton again, and i will be sure to let everyone know what a nightmare this stay was.

"while visiting the chicago area, we chose the hotel monaco chicago for our stay. as one of the premier luxury hotels in chicago, we held high expectations but were quickly disappointed in what we recieved. the problems began as soon as we arrived. the attendant was not friendly nor did she have the smile that is suppose to be the symbol of kimpton. and, when we went to our room only to discover that we had not been given what we had paid for, the situation only got worse. rather than apologize for the error (my credit card receipt was on hand) we were blamed for the indescrpencies in rooms and told that not only was the room we had reserved and paid for more than two months unavailable, we would not recieve a refund of the price difference of the two rooms. i could not believe that a top 40 u.s. hotel that is suppose to be committed to excellence could make such a blunder! with no choice but to retreat back to our room, we were pleasantly pleased with all of the amenities that we did recieve during our stay. a beautiful hotel in the chicago loop, but don't go expecting to be treated with respect or professionalism.

"the sofitel chicago water tower in the downtown area is advertised as a four-star luxury hotel. however, modern architecture and a convenient location seem to be its only reliable perks. room service is available 24 hours a day, but offers a limited variety of items and often lethargic service. two bars are located on the premises, which is appealing at first. once inside, patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy, of any kind. the guest rooms are relatively spacious and clean, but a lack of adequate toiletries and personal items can interfere with a guests routine. obtaining additional towels and grooming products is much too difficult. if you are a traveler who is in search of a relaxing and hassle-free experience, with reliable customer service, booking a room here is probably not a viable option.

"i was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it. unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least. but let me begin with the things that i do like about the hotel. first off, it is located my favorite part of chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is chicago's equivalent of manhattan's upper east side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of gap, banana republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, hermes of paris (which warrants a separate mention). i also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork. the very reason why i always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains. i definitely love the room. while the space issue is not as bad in chicago as it is in manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task. so we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed and still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my herve and louboutins in. my only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again delaware st is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof. i mean, seriously. they don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason. i did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so i do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that i would be getting from say, a 3000-room vegas hotel. first, i called in to reconfirm my reservation. the lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent. first off, she was not able to find my reservation and i was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom i had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). the person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either. case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which i agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there. but the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1am. as a general rule, i am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account. think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite. so i really wasn't expecting hotels as small as talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. i placed an order of chicken blt, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes. then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) i opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of lay's chips (lightly salted flavor). the bread looked like someone stomped on it, the l and t looked like it was 2 days old, the b was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold. it was pathetic room service at its finest. we did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant. the whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. we won't be coming back, unfortunately.

"our check-in was great, but then we got into our room. the carpet was drenched and stained near the bathroom because the shower (open concept) leaks water onto the floor since there are no doors on it. the mini bar was broken and put an extremely foul scent into the room. our final hotel bill reflected 2 charges that were incorrect....1 for the mini bar which we did not utilize, and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine ($69 instead of $50). when my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected, he was met with a very unfriendly and unapologetic employee. it was adjusted, but not without confrontation. there was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same ""mysterious"" mini bar charge on her bill as well, and was trying to have it corrected. overall, the location of the hard rock was nice but it will be the last time that we stay in one,

"i found this hotel in the ""small luxury hotels of the world"" booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years, and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels. i therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from england. the talbott was excellently located, although i had a view of a building site, and did have an ambience and some charm, however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling. i had to wait in the foyer well after check in time, having previously attempted to check in earlier, tired and in need of a rest, while a ""final check"" was done to my room. the valet parking was not outside when requested, breakfast was not included in the price, all the things requested of reception did not occur, and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special. i have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant, where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel. i was severely disappointed and cannot recommend it at all.

"i have stayed in the talbott a few times and had always liked it. this time was my first visit in 2 years and i was disappointed. the hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced. i had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window. the lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright. the bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room. the ac unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off. having stayed there before i know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others i have been in and the risk is getting it again. other small things contributed - the lobby brownies are no longer, there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee (so you couldn't walk out with the coffee) and i got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5-night stay. the construction noise was not too bad but does start at 7.30am and goes on until around 8pm, including weekends.

"i can see how this place must have been gorgeous at one time but they really need a makeover. 1. there was a huge gaping hole in the carpet on the bedroom floor. i kid you not. how can they have guests in a room where the carpet looks like it had been mauled by a giant earthworm? 2. the furniture was severely chipped. ok. i dont mind chipped furniture if i am slumming it in my just-out-of-college-sister's apartment. but for 170+ a night, i want a room that does not look like it was furnished with stuff retrieved from a dumpster drive 3. the receptionist while i was checking in was super curt. i know it was late but isnt that sort of your job? not everything was horribly bad though. the one star is for the bathroom that was super clean. i do not recommend this place at all.

"i chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed. the previous weekend, i stayed at a 2.5 star hotel a few blocks away, and was much more impressed there. the hard rock had a number of issues including: very dark room - not much light (artificial or natural); lots of street noise; very cheap decor and furniture; broken cabinet door; very warm room - said they would send maintenance, but they never arrived; had bar charges on account that were not ours. overall, i was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel. i expected a much better experience!

"if you asked me two years ago, i would have recommended the talbott hotel without hesitation to anyone who asked. now, i have definitely changed my mind. while this hotel is located in a nice area of chicago, surrounded by great restaurants, shops and affluent people, it has really begun to slowly downgrade. as noted by my reviews, i am incredibly serious about customer service. if you're in the hospitality industry, there is really no excuse for falling short in this category--- but alas, the talbott really has. the door staff don't say a word, the desk people acknowledge you only when they are not doing a million other things (which they always are) and the staff have an air of snobbishness. inexcusable since we, the customers, are paying to stay at their over-priced hotel. perhaps the most annoying aspect of my latest stay was that i had to walk down 11 flights of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel because i waited a solid 15 minutes for the elevator, which, when it arrived, was packed to the brim. i get that it's an old hotel, but it is incredibly annoying that they only have two elevators for the entire place and when one is down for construction, the other one overflows with people and i am forced to walk eleven flights to simply get to my dinner reservation on time (which i didn't.) i will not continue giving this hotel my business and have other better recommendations to give to friends who plan on visiting.

"this is a tough one to review... as the star ratings were from 1 star to 5 and had to figure out an average.... 2 is where it was. here are my tips and props/complaints: room: 1 star. i had a corner suite. the room was pretty nasty actually (2703..stay away from it!!!). there was a constant banging noise from above. when i first got in i thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding. after an hour, i knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong. well, the sound continued on for 3 days. not that i minded too much as i keep things on for white noise... but it sure would bug others. also, there were about 10 cig burns on the carpet and sofa. in addition, it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa. also, there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat. i could not imagine all the dna left on that thing either. *gags* bathroom: nice size but not great. the faucet was lose (really lose) and the toilet would not flush right. service: great. everyone i encountered did a great job making me feel welcome. good stuff. food: i had meetings there, so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made. it was really good... much better than most hotels. bar: very cool. good music, great service and good drinks. the scene was decent as well. small bar, but was not cramped. so, maybe other rooms are nicer... well hell they better be. regardless, if one room is like that (especially a ""suite""), i have to think others are like that as well. it is too bad though. the views are great and they actually have windows that open... big shocker for the city in general!

"i was scheduled to stay at the hard rock in june, but had to cancel. i had booked the hotel back in january. when i called six days before my arrival date to cancel, i was told that i would be charged for my stay because i did not cancel seven days in advance. i told the customer service rep that i had never heard of such a practice, but she said, in a very smug manner, that i was told back in january. i honestly don't remember being told of the cancellation policy, but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel. i, for one, will never stay at a hard rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business associaties know of this unfair practice.

"i selected the talbott after 3 hrs comparing hotels online. we have had wonderful experiences with boutiques (monaco, allegro) and assumed this would be comparable. good points: the lobby is beautiful, and one staff member took roses i bought for my wife and arranged them nicely. the many problems: when my wife called with a question on our arrival day, the agent could find no reservation -- 15 mins later she was transferred to another person who found the record instantly. when we arrived, the lobby was stuffed with students; nobody tried to manage the group, several of whom pushed ahead to the check-in desk. we left our bags and went out for 2 hrs so we could check in with less hassle. we finally were checked in, after waiting 15 mins while the confused desk clerk searched for rooms. when we got there, our room had not been made up from the last guest. when we complained, we were given an ""upgrade"" to a room that was old and uninspired. chairs are scuffed, closet shelves are bowed, the air conditioner is noisy, and a wall lamp is loose. the view is of a construction site. movies-on-demand are dated. we expect this from a budget hotel, not one positioning itself as elegant and upscale. when we returned after an evening out, the card reader to open the main doors did not work. one staff member admonished us (really) for not using the reader, when in fact we had tried. this was embarrassing, as others were standing in the lobby. i tried to access the hotel's wifi network, but was only given a $9.95 upgrade option. i called the desk, and was told to ""click past it"", which of course did nothing. it wasn't until 2 hrs later the complimentary access worked. we are pretty easygoing; we love good treatment and tip handsomely. if we had only 1or 2 problems, we wouldn't write. in fact, we would not have written except the hotel did not make things right. the president wrote a letter, and suggested others at the hotel would be in touch...nobody ever was.

"i can easily say this is one of the worst hotels i've stayed at the. the receptionist up front was a snooty, sarcastic teenager or post teenager. you can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner. the room was dirty, stains on the carpet, the showerhead was moldy and rusted, the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches. the towels had a horrible aroma. the hotel is very narrow, so we were near a construction zone so, i would plan on waking up at 6:am if you choose the talbott. the next day, i asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room. that room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop. i asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day, if were not out by noon. i had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm. please stay away from this hotel, i think a holiday inn would be better. andrew f. gulli

"we reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay. after checking in and unpacking, we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed (supposedly during renovation). the front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all 4 of us check into the room. colleen, one of the managers, was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem. we ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed. we never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently ""absent from the hotel"" during most of our stay. we stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence. we had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology. the lack of training of the staff was clearly evident, as was the cavalier attitude of the management.

"great building and location, but... staff is indifferent, you have to pay for wifi (after $300 usd/night i would expect at least free wifi), no pool in the building and something i found really annoying is that, if you move anything from the minibar, they have sensors that automatically charge you. this is ridicoulus.the ipod dock in the room didn't work. also, we had to move thenightstand between beds and found dirt all over. definitely is not value for your money. you're just paying for the hard rock brand. i will never go back to a hard rock hotel.

"my wife and i just spent the labor day weekend in the city, choosing the hard rock hotel as our pad. we've stayed at the hrh in orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there. it's not that way here. these may be all ticky tacky things, but they added up to us. first of all, the room. we upgraded our reservation thru the hrh website for a room with ""an incredible view"". well, our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us. that was all we could see. so there was no view. the room was muggy. we had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74. we woke up sweaty both days. when we opened the window to get a breeze, the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing. the room was small and dark, but it didn't bother us that much. the bed may have been the mosr comfortable bed i ever slept in. and we even joked about stealing the pillows! we had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster, but they removed the charges no prob. throughout the entire hotel, i counted a total of 3 pieces of music memorabilia. i thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to renovate an old hotel, throw a styx guitar on the wall, and slap a hrh emblem on the outside. the hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation. the location is good, right on the south end of the mag mile, but there are 10-15 better hotels in a better location to shopping, quality eats, and navy pier. if you have a car, parking will cost you $38/day, which is prob normal for downtown. the hotel restaurant was a chinese restaurant. the bar was small and trendy, and i guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a pina colada and they told us they didn't have a blender. whaat???? a hrh without a blender? did they not know that jimmy buffet was in town???? mind blowing! i would never, never, never go back here. like i said, there are many better hotels in much better locations. i will stay at the hrh in orlando or elsewhere again.

""nobody told us, we can't do anything for you."" ""are you sure that you arranged this?"" two quotes so typical for this hotel's staff that i know that i will never stay at this hotel again. i understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel, but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what i know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste.[-----]

"i booked two rooms four months in advance at the talbott. we were placed on the top floor next to the elevators, which are used all night long. when speaking to the front desk, i was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor, which i had requested for a better view. i am looking at a brick wall, and getting no sleep. he also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor, and were aware of the noise problem. why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked? a request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the top floor and using that request to justify this. if you decide to stay here, request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator! i spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences. this is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain.

"we chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds. we anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel, than some of the other larger high rise hotels. we did not experience very good service at the talbott hotel. when we checked irena seemed very robotic and aloof. the front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious. the lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door. each time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff, just a blank stare and gaze. the front desk staff was chilly and stiff, no greetings, no smiles and no personality. they had difficulty answering simple questions or requests. on the other hand the bellman perry was great. he was sociable and very service oriented. he was aware of what is going on in the area. he recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area, and where to eat in the neighborhood. he is authentic and he even asked us upon our return ""how was that restaurant?"" tim the concierge was also supportive. he gave us 10% discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores. we had the largest suite. we requested a rollaway (extra charge) when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10pm. when the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed. what made our talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned. we were out of our room from 8am and when we returned to our room at 4pm the rooms had not been cleaned. we called the front desk to ask to send someone. the maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening. the room itself was pleasant. it did have a moldy smell and some frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much. we were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin. we really liked staying in this area of chicago but expected first rate service. the service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel.

"avoid the talbot, especially for group functions. my in-laws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests. they were lured in by promises from the talbot, that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide ""special, personal treatment"". nothing could have been further from the truth. they failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception, they persistently confused reservation requests, they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests, his wife, and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight. now the worse part. mistakes are made, even hotel managers are human, but where a hotel, which is supposed to be in the hospitality service, can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error. case in point: i had requested on several occasions when i made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card, all expenses, they assurred me that this would be no problem. of course, when my brother, his wife, and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid chicago after six hours of travel they wouldn't let them check in until they physically saw my card... again despite them having my card on record, and despite my explaining this to them over the phone. my brother recalls the ""indignation"" of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card. then another guest, in this case my older brother, came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby. when i finally was able to get across town, leaving a cubs game early, i again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account. again they agreed, but never did anything about it. in the end when my older brother checked out on sunday he was told everything was alright, but when he went to his atm his account was frozen from ""unathorized overuse"". the hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained. when he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events. i spent sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on monday, the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone, calling the talbot, the credit card fraud division, my brother, etc trying to solve this situation. the most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager, who at one point suggested that ""i was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters"".... this was a witnessed event, and her insinuation was that i was lying, and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake. in the end, there is no one running this place... managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail. when i was finally able to get the name of the general manager (after two days)m neither he nor his assistant would ever call back. the communication between the staff and mangement is non-existant. fortuneatly the staff at the signature room (where we had the reception) was beyond excellent so the day was not lost, but the the talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests. try the ambassador east (same neighborhood) cheaper, much more professional staff.

"great front desk staff, the rest of the experience was dreadful. the room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained i have ever encountered. we had to ask four times for the staff not to slam the supply closet, adjacent to our room (almost in the room itself). they do these random room checks for the minibar, as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of $9 peanuts. the roomservice is also equipped with walkie-talkies as loud as megaphones. if you like sleeping in on your vacation, don't stay here. also, the hotel was under massive construction, a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website. so we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it. no discount because of the work and noise. i'd rather sleep in a box in the alley.

"we stayed at this hotel in february 2010. the room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for united way. so we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity. we were woke up at 3:00am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor. of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours. they were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on. we called the front desk who sent security up immediately. security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave. we called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down. because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted. when we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate. well we still paid for it!!. they would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had. we would never stay at this hotel again, obviously they really don't care about their guests.

"the talbott hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges. no - not a bit worn - very much so i'm sorry to say. although the location a block and a half from the best part of michigan ave. can't be beat, and the level of service is on par with many four seasons, there were quite a few bumps in the road. number one, the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing. the desk chair was so badly worn that the ""lift"" button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we're not grossly obese. the back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable. my husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth, one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk. the bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink, so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door. the towels were very well worn and thin, although bath sized, which was a plus. the restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say, it was horrific. we had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables, and they (appetizers) were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen. a room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side, served on a large white plate, and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic american cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad. even the menu, as limited as it was, looked as though someone's child had written it out. the good news is that chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go. unfortunately for us, the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid $325/nt for our disappointments. the good news is that the mini bars' wares were incredibly well-priced - when's the last time you had a $4 beer anywhere in a hotel? (even if it was bud and bud lite - lol!~) the front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating. the water out of the shower was hot and plentiful, and the bed comfortable. the a/c was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever, and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90's our entire stay. free wi-fi - yes! and it wasn't horribly grindingly slow! no need for the advertised ""upgrade"" for faster wi-fi. talbott - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game. apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased, but we were sadly not.

"the hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night. for three consecutive nights. there was simply inadequate soundproofing - even 14 floors above the street (ok - 13 floors as there is no 13th floor). i hesitate to write this review but i rely on trip advisor reviews when traveling, and had i been warned about the ambulance sirens, i would have chosen to stay elsewhere. if you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value. conveniently located. wonderful staff. but quiet is a key priority for me so i would not stay here again. :(

"my husband and i stayed overnight at the affinia. prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel; not true. since it was a very special occasion, and also because we were only staying overnight, we didn't let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend. however, this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences. i've ever had. first, the smells: the linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy. the odors were not mild, and i found it pretty repulsive. i couldn't wait to jump out of bed in the morning, to get away from the odors. hard to sleep and certainly didn't want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary. i didn't discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed. at that point, i chose not to contact housekeeping because (a) i was exhausted, and (b) i didn't want to upset my husband, who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing. also, the bathroom smelled like vinegar. perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by affinia, but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did. incidentally, the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days; not a well-maintained property. second, the elevators: if you stay above the first few floors, there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c-view bar. with so many floors to service, and so many people going up to the c-view bar on a saturday, these elevators took forever to come, and were often full they did. annoying. also, on one occasion, there were several bottles (water and soda) left in the elevator; clearly, the maintenance crew doesn't inspect and clean the common areas frequently. finally, and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived. first, when we booked, we asked for as quiet a room as possible. the hotel is located near northwestern memorial hospital. but, its proximity to michigan ave., and the lack of accomodations elsewhere (due to the transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week-end), led us to stay here anyway. at check-in, the clerk noted our request, and said our room was quiet room since it was not ""next to the elevators."" when we arrived at our room, we discovered that we were across from the elevators. obviously, she was technically correct that we weren't next to the elevators, but it was still so close (15-20 feet) that we could hear the elevator noise. also, since it was a special occasion, we asked if we could upgrade. the disingenuous, snarky, condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade. clearly, the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels, this is a matter of routine, not exception. pretty awful experience all the way around. other reviewers must have very low expectations. can't explain any of the good reviews otherwise.

"stayed at the fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on tripadvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel. good location but the room was dirty, and not just from the last housekeeping. it was dingy: a place where you needed the slippers they provided. and this was a suite. also, the refrigerator was caked with ice and didn't work. furthermore, because my travel agent had mixed up the dates i was to travel, i showed up a day late. the hotel said it wasn't a problem and that i wouldn't be charged for the no-show the night before. i had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day. then the fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve. neither i nor my corporate travel desk will use the fitzpatrick again. two dots only because it's in a good location and because the lobby was clean. i'm generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad.

"let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 5-6 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis (not including our business travel). we've traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail. we were not at all impressed by this hotel. at $220/night we were expecting a decent, clean hotel but obviously not a 5*. we were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given (1546). the paint/wallpaper/tub were peeling, there was hair in both the tub/toilet when we got to the room, the internet service was extremely slow, the toilet ran throughout the night, and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in. we told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was ""i know, we can't wait for our renovations."" if it hadn't been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the uk & booked into this hotel by a travel agent, we would have checked out as soon as we checked in. let me also add that the front desk seemed short-staffed as the check-in/check-out process was painfully slow. all we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendly/responsive door staff. in its day this was likely a lovely hotel & but it is in dire need of a renovation. despite its location i cannot understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a sub-par experience. we would never book at this hotel again.

"when you're standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all, nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again. the worst part is that the hotel knows this is a problem (they told me that it happens to the upper floors, and i wasn't even staying on the highest floor!) as if that makes it ok. i can look past the ""rustic"" decor of the room and take it for what it is - an inexpensive place to crash, but c'mon, a girl's gotta shower.

"stay away! after generations as an old-world, cozy and stately, if a bit tired oasis, the ae has been purchased by ian schrager and taken down so many notches it's almost not functional. allowing for the fact that the hotel is under renovation, the entrance is not handicapped accessible, and i saw several hotel guests with canes, casts, etc (including myself, recovering from foot surgery and in a cast, with a cane) struggling with the up and down outside stairs one has to navigate just to get into and out of the hotel. with luggage, it's almost impossible. this is simply inexcusable. i've been a customer of the ambassador east for decades--but no more. the hallways are so dark one can barely see. the rooms are stark white, which in and of itself, isn't a particular problem, but it is jarring and almost painful as one's eyes adjust from the dark hallways. the furniture--stark and scant--looks like something from an ikea closeout. the bed is comfortable--what a relief--but only about 15 inches off of the floor, a real problem if you're at all physically challenged, or even elderly and less flexible than you were in your salad days. the problems don't end there. my room had a horribly uncomfortable wire/metal desk chair, and absolutely nowhere else to sit. no arm chair, no demi-sofa, no ottoman. with a foot in a cast, it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably, perhaps even with my leg elevated, while in the room. no way. the bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries. not a shelf, a small table, a nook, or a medicine cabinet. if you want to put a razor, shaving cream, makeup (for women) or anything else down so that you can use them, you're sh*t out of luck. repeated requests for a small table or some sort of chair went unmet. a borrowed umbrella from the front desk was broken and unusable, something i didn't discover until caught in an expected downpour. i was tempted to throw it out, but remembered that they would charge me for it if i didn't return it, in spite of its total lack of usefulness. refrigerator--forget it. shampoo? for two days in a row, the housekeeper left several bottles of lotion, and no shampoo. room service--not available. if you want breakfast, the front desk will sell you a small, pre-wrapped, commercial grade muffin for $4.00--something you can buy in any gas station for $1.00. no added value whatsoever. the photos show a nice entrance, and a large lobby for which the ae has long been famous. unfortunately, that lobby is closed off, under construction, and the temporary lobby is on the second floor, difficult, again, for handicapped access. thermos-bottled coffee and water for tea were stone cold, at 8 in the morning. when confronted with these various misses, the front desk staff repeatedly shrugged their shoulders and said, ""yeah, we know, you're not the first to tell us this stuff."" all this shows is that schrager doesn't even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable, and that the staff is either too indifferent or too amateur to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right. it's one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when it's under renovation. it's another thing altogether to get screwed in the bargain, particularly after booking a non-refundable pre-paid reservation. again, avoid this hotel like the plague.

"we were encouraged to stay at the affinia as part of a group in town for a chicago wedding. we booked our rooms 6 months in advance, with the promise of a brand-new, full service hotel in a great locaiton in chicago. the lobby was non-existant (under construction). the front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful. the hallways and elevators are small, cramped and uncomfortable. the rooms are great - great beds, great television set. no room service - the kitchen is under construction. the bottom line is that during our stay, this was not a full-service hotel and should not have charged what they did. we were totally disappointed, hope it will improve, but vow to never stay there and will recommend to anyone to check out one of chicago's truly amazing hotels. it is not worth the risk with this unproven dress rehearsal.

"i've been here for 4 days. great location right off of miracle mile, near all major hotels, best shopping and theatres. rooms very large. hotel staff very friendly and helpful, and respond immediately. problems: there frequently are homeless people (even during daylight) on superior between st. clair and michigan avenue (the main route you walk for or all activities, and just about everything is in walking distance from here). at night, the street on the north side of superior is dark, and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors. the street people do not approach you, although they may stare as you go by. usually 2 or more along the way, where they sleep on the window sills of neiman marcus. i would not think a woman would feel safe by herself. (i am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia.) there are homeless up and down michigan street, but this is different as it's a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street. the entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work, and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation. for now, expect two extremely small, warm, slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm, cramped hallways! all the walls throughout the hotel need painting, and the wallpaper is peeling in places. in the room, several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection, the carpets were stained, the bathrooms needed new grout (some mold visible), the tv is very small (16 inch?) and the windows very, very dirty. you won't get your room serviced unless you ask for it, sometimes more than once. the ""pub "" downstairs is run down, dark and kind of creepy. food and room service are very expensive, as is parking ($34/day public and $38/day valet). on the plus side, the bed was very comfortable, there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area, plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans st. clair street toward the north and south. you can see a sliver of lake michigan. pool small, but clean. all in all, it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room, but i think it is overpriced, and i would not stay here again.

"has gone downhill so much we almost checked out. we stayed in the dean martin celebrity suite for 3 nights while entertaining customers in chicago. we've stayed there for many years and while not up to date like the four seasons or the peninsula, it has always been a comfortable and clean, service oriented hotel. not only has room service been eliminated (if you want room service it comes from marios italian restaurant down the street, so is only italian), complimentary morning coffee is no longer available, mini bars have been removed from the rooms, etc. etc. the only restaurant, the pump room was closed for a private function on saturday night, the bar also, so we weren't even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests. surely the function was planned before we made our reservations, but we weren't told of it. we also learned that the bell staff (who have been there for 13 and 8 years) is being eliminated. so, in other words, anyting to do with ""service"" is gone from this hotel. i hear they are going to begin renovations in december, but that is no excuse to let an old glory ""go to pot"" in the meantime. we won't be staying here when we go back in july or for thanksgiving. we even had to pay for internet. mind you, our bill for 3 nights was 900.00+, no room service, no restaurant/bar charges. highway robbery for what you get ow at the ambassador east. sad.

"the good - excellent location, neighborhood is pretty and quiet, close to shops, restaurants, the waterfront, close to train/subway station, etc the bad - very old decor, which isn't a big deal, but the tv was smaller than my pc monitor. we were supposed to have a king bed (anniversary trip) we were given two double beds and told we would be switched - that never happened. the shower/tub was stopped up so bad that after i showered my husband waited over one hour for the tub to drain before he could shower. who wants to shower in someone else's dirty water even if it is your wife. the indifferent - room was a decent size, bed linens were okay, staff was mediocre to marginally rude

"i have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood, cost and amenities. the hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open, you wouldn't know it. you need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock. the beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a ""nicer historic hotel."" i will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime. it was a very frustrating experience.

"the ambassador east was a average hotel at best, and mediocre at worst. the bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff. the doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you. the room was lackluster, however. the bathroom was in especially bad shape. it was dirty when we arrived, with hair in the sink and shower. the shower was in really bad shape. the shower head adjustment did not work properly and water pressure was very low. the water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit. the decor throughout the hotel (lobby, hallways and rooms) was very out-of-date and old-fashioned. i would have liked there to have been a vending machine in the hotel as well. the business center with free internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use. the hotel's location was okay though it was a bit of a hike to the most popular tourist destinations. i would not stay at this hotel again based on its current conditions, but if it underwent some renovations to update the rooms and the bathrooms, i might be inclined to stay there again. ...read more

"this hotel was chosen for me for a business convention. the lobby was pretty cool. but the rooms were tiny and very dark. i had a huge picture of kiss above my toilet. it was very hard to do my makeup or read because of the lighting. the location is ok. you have to walk a few blocks to get to the best part of michigan ave, but its not too bad. be prepared for some sad sights after dark. apparently panhandling is permitted in chicago ( some cities will give you a ticket for begging) because at night, the beggars come out. the saddest thing i saw was an older woman with her two grandkids sitting on a curb in the freezing snow on a -5 temp night. those kids looked terrible. unfortunatly its all up and down the wealthiest part of the city. you don't see so many in the daylight. also the room service at the hard rock is pretty good. its plenty for 2 people. i would not stay here again though. i suggest the omni hotel.

"i was initially very excited to be staying at the ambassador east hotel. the photos online appeared very classy and upscale and i thought staying there would be a pleasant experience. upon arrival i was very disappointed - the main lobby was closed for construction making it somewhat difficult to get around. our room was very dated - old furnishings and linens, damaged tile - it fell quite short for the high price we paid. it is an older building with very thin walls allowing you to clearly hear all other guests in surrounding rooms and also the lovely slam of doors of departing guests in the morning. doorways are extremely narrow in hallways and room - gives a very claustrophobic feel to the hotel.

"in my experience the ambassador hotel didn't seem to be a 3 1/2 star establishment. the building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated. the carpeting was very old and worn. the floor - carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable. i would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel. currently, it's indespirate need of renovation.

"any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth: eventually the lodging deteriorates. but you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time! i have been staying at the talbott for several decades. yes, changes have been made, like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance, most recently. but other things have gone downhill. for the last several stays i have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service. rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions. this is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of the talbott, but not this less-than-maintained lodging. i, personally, am shopping for a new home away from home.

"i had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance, yet was given a room facing the street from which i could hear traffic noise. i asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day. the next morning, prior to being moved to a quiet room, the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood. about an hour later i was moved to a room which did not face the street. the room was quiet but smaller and darker. the mattresses in each room were very firm, i would even say hard. i asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same. at checkout i tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under, and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes, which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside, with other passengers. (the cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later.) as recompense for the noise, flood, etc., the hotel offered exactly nothing. not a great stay.

"i had purchased this deal of off groupon. lets just say we found a bunch of hidden treasures. when we layed down to sleep in our bed. we lifted our blanket and found very distubing spotting on our bed (attached in photos), we immediatly called the front desk. the only thing they offered was a new set of sheets. when the room service men came to change the sheets he brought us another one with a big red stain on it and quickly/hid changed it before we seen it and he apologized and offered to bring us new ones once again. we denied since it was so late and just slept on the sheets the appeared to be clean. then next day i eagerly showed the fronk desk and manager the photos, and they offered me a ($68) refund. i was very dissapointed,and dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and sleepless and i broke out on my face with acne (i never had a acne or skin issues) im positive something in those dirtyy sheets. we drove 4.5 hours to enjoy chicago and we stayed @ the hard rock based on reputatuion, and unfortunitly we were very disspointed. it was disgusting! i then wrote a email to management and heard nothing back. not even a response or apology. i just really expected alot more.

"i arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from california. i didn't know about the renovation when i made the reservations, but that didn't bother me very much. i was helped by a man at the front desk named ben, who was friendly enough, but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay. he gave me no information about anything. i had no idea where breakfast was served, or even if there was breakfast. there was also an extremely unpleasant woman working behind the desk(she wasn't wearing a name tag but was african american, slim with short hair) who seemed to be actually radiating hostility. it made me very uncomfortable and needless to say, made me feel unwelcome. i actually felt like i was putting her out by staying in the hotel. i encountered her again the next morning when i had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit, and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness. i also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners. no matter what may be going on in one's life, when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile. i was appalled by her demeanor. my room was alright, there was no clock which i found very odd. since i came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and i was constantly confused as to which one was correct, especially upon waking up in the morning. it would have been nice to have a clock. there was also no literature on local sites, maps, restaurant menus, or even anything with the hotel's name and address in the room. also, the mattress was the absolute worst mattress i've ever slept on in my life. i woke up every morning with a sore back and neck. i've had better sleep on a hard, lumpy futon. it was absurd. like another person posted, my tub did not drain either, and i was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found. maybe they were around somewhere, but i wasn't made aware of it at check-in, and i didn't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like i was a burden to the employees. the hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance, but i absolutely would not stay here again. i've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel, which was a bummer because it was my first visit to chicago and i had pretty high expectations.

"we booked through a travel website. this hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in september. the public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done. the hallway was so dimly lit, we couldn't see how to use the key card. the shock came when we entered the room. whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guest's comfort into consideration. the bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground - a mattress (rock hard) over a platform. the ""nigh stands"" were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height. the room was stark - all off-white, no color. no art work or any decoration at all. the full-length drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit; if it were winter and the heat was on, i think this could be dangerous. there was a desk & chair but no clock/radio in the room; there was a wall mounted lcd tv with very poor channel selection. the bathroom was very small but clean. the problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to. an older person could have never stayed in the room. because of the renovation, there was no restaurant on-site. no vending or ice available on the floor either i can't see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel. i would never stay there again.

"i can't recall another time i've had to deal with such rude front desk help. while pleasant initially, as soon as i demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that i was still waiting to claim my luggage for check-in (i arrived prior to check-in time, so they were holding a few bags), the true quality of this establishment surfaced. never mind that the luggage wasn't sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 7:30pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop. while that was a bit annoying, the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of donna, the very attractive but aloof front desk employee. her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness, as i noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay, including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning. i also booked a rate that included parking, which donna acknowledged at check-in but at check out billed me separately; i assume after i got on her bad side. even with my last polite good bye to the front desk, i felt a phony, uppity attitude from donna, and i really can't convey the extent of how insulting it felt. i can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to chicago. the hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy. great location as well. to be fair, most of the staff seemed very friendly, and i am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier. but i think most travelers, like me, would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service, so as to not have a ""situation"" that could single-handedly ruin a travel experience. unfortunately, that was the case here.

"i booked this hotel for a business trip since i was able to get a $129 rate on travelzoo and figured i'd save my company some money. i had also read excellent reviews on tripadvisor. i had a guaranteed and confirmed room reservation for two nights in november. when i arrived in chicago at 7:30pm i decided to go to dinner prior to checking in so called the hotel to request a late check in and was told ""no problem."" when i arrived at the hotel at 11:45pm i was told they didn't have a room for me and that i'd have to move to the four points sheraton which they paid for. it was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away. i was told that they overbooked and didn't get as many cancellations as they expected. i did check into the hotel the next day and once there did have a good experience. i would recommend staying here but do ensure that your reservation is indeed confirmed and avoid any late check-ins or you might not have a room! the ""experience designers"" were great and very helpful. the rooms were very nice and comfortable (felt like home). the breakfast could stand to add on some bagels for the ""healthy factor."" it was nice that they did have fruit. i think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotel--they just need to get the basics down!

"this hotel is rather stupid to be frank. it's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that saturday night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional. the rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isn't much in them. i actually like the pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink. i had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days. it also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything. i had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b/c the bathroom doors aren't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan! it was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night. on a good note, the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean. that's about the only good thing i can say about this place. i would not go back.

"we stay at the palmer house when we attend conferences in chicago. it is a stately building. but this year, there were ... problems we have not had before. first, they now have wi-fi available, but it is not free. the cost is $7.50 per hour. on-line it indicated that hilton hotels charge about $4, but this was almost double. many hotels have free wi-fi. wi-fi is wi-fi, so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost. they also charge for their fitness center, even when you are only going to use the machines. there is no business center in-house for copies, etc. our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room. it did not separate us from the bathroom noises. when someone took a shower (at 5:30 a.m.), the pipes ""sung"" like old pipes do,but very loudly. an empty wine glass sat outside someone's room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping. the concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line. if you called down, you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line. the staff were all very nice, and the location can't be beat, but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year. i doubt we'll return....

"i have stayed at the palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok. the main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center, which is truly annoying. in addition, there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator. other than that, it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm. but, the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable. the door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk, and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed. there was no room for them to put the tv in front of the bed, so they shoved it off to the side. room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and i promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel. it should not be sold as a hotel room.

"i stayed at the allegro hotel while interviewing for a position in chicago. i read the reviews and they were mixed, but since the property was suggested by the organization (due to location), i booked a room. true to the reviews, the room was extremely small, was cold (the heater blew in cold air in -2 degree weather), and just generally uncomfortable. there was no closet so i hung my suit on the doorknob of the door of the adjoining room. the bathroom was extremely small and although tidy, not especially clean (it was dusty). the bed (which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full) was quite low and the sheets were hard. because i arrived late, i ordered room service. there was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to approach the desk/table sideways. although there is free wireless (a plus), i kept getting kicked out of the system and had to, no lie, reconnect on-line a record 16 times. finally, to top it all off, the television stopped working just a little before midnight. i was only there for one evening (not even 12 hours) but that was enough for me. this is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but i've stayed at better 2 star properties. on the positive side, the staff is nice and friendly, the food is reasonably good, and the lobby is really vibrant. there is a martini bar (although as i was coming in, a hotel guest was complaining about it being unsually smokey) that looked interesting. overall though, not the best stay i've had. i won't be staying again.

"when you check into a hotel after being stuck in a airport, you areusually not in the best of mood. i, working in a upscale hotel, do encounter many guests checking in who this has happened to. all they want is a friendly face and a smooth check in. the desk clerk who checked me in at this property, did neither. she was short, rude, handed me my keys and walked away. i would never go back to this property due to this.

"i stayed at palmer house for one night in early january this year. during the check in, the front desk lady asked me to show my confirmation letter of my reservation. i did not bring the confirmation with me because i had not been asked to present it in other places during check in.so she asked to print out one copy in their business center and bring the confirmation to the bell station to get the room key. i did what she told me and went to the bell station. however, people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key. a bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk. i finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes. as other people pointed out before, the room i got was small and old with a twin bed, and i could hear people next door using the bathroom. this was not a pleasant experience, even though i paid over 100 dollars to the hotel.

"me and my husband stayed in the allegro hotel chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently. we got a room with a king size bed.. although the room is small, we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages & all. however, we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable, the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us. the walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound. 1 of the days, our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels, rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign. the worst is upon returning to the hotel at night, we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage. the housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins. this is unacceptable to us. the hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night. although it is near the cta trains, i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view. am staying again at a kimpton hotel in san fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change! overall, not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to chicago again!

"we stayed at amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more. it's a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but it's just not worth the money. it does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast. the sheets though, made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things. the breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt. otherwise, it's just an early morning sugar attach of muffins, danishes, sweet breads, and croissants. there are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety, if you are into that sort of thing. also, the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room. the problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time, alternating between cold and warm, right over the bed. there is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale. they do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free. the problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there. one person at a time... all and all, we will not stay there again. if we feel like luxury, we have to find some other place. but if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city, maybe we will try red roof inn or something like that. at least we'll know what we are paying for.

"the hotel is excellently situated for visiting the art institute or millennium park. it is an ""old classic"" of a hotel, and the main lobby is a must see, but i would not stay there again. the problem with any hotel dating from long ago (the current one was built in 1923-25) is that, even with extensive remodeling (which was done in 2007-2009) it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today (in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much). we had a reasonably sized room (king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair) but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries. also, there was no coffee machine in the room - something i have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days. my major complaint about this stay was the executive lounge. it is usually worth while to pay the extra for access - in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors d'oeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price. (since we are currently at the diamond level in the hilton honors program, we get access for free at the hiltons but i usually upgrade at other chains such as the hyatt.) at the palmer executive lounge i ordered a couple of glasses of wine (there was a bartender on duty) and was slightly surprised by the cost - $9/glass which came to $21.44 for two with tax and tip - and was even more surprised by the wine. it was about the worst wine i had tasted in many years. i didn't think it was even as good as trader joe's cheapest $2.99 wine that i tried a couple of weeks ago. unfortunately i didn't get a look at the bottle to see what it was (although i did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard). i noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in - and i can understand iot at the prices they were charging. it then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time. i checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass - the same three varietals as at the bar. the cabernet was a william hill at $10.50/glass from room service. i presume that what i had had at some time been a william hill that had been left to turn to vinegar. it was slightly more expensive from room service, but i hope that it was in a lot better condition.

"where do i start. the gm was a nice guy for handling the incident i had. anthony -the concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable. anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice. he set me up and quoted me a price of $125, when i got to the spa (which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon) i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was $100 with 20% off. at the end of the massage i gave the lady $100 and said thanks you can keep the change, she insisted that i got ""a hotel rate"" because anthony set me up. she called anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay anthony the difference - $45. she then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which i declined. in short - shady dealings with this place. i was quite taken back. the gm selman comp'd me a night but , i felt swindled big time. stay somewhere else. the concierge has something going on...

"this is my letter to the management..... sir or madam: i am writing to give feedback about our recent stay the amalfi. we were a guest from 11/20 to 11/23. during our stay we used the ""valet"" service operated through standard parking. our vehicle was returned with stolen items from the glove compartments. much to my chagrin, $44/day valet service did not include proper security/monitoring, despite the premium over ""self park"". i understand that these parking services are sub-contracted by the hotel, but i would think that any worthy hotel would remedy the situation. this was not the case. i hope that your staff will be able to take measures to rectify the situation for future guests

"beautiful historic hotel -- and since i'm in historic building business, was looking forward to stay. moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite, they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up -- duct work torn apart in bathroom, lamp fixtures literally falling off wall, mirror torn off wall, etc. ended up in a room on 20th floor -- much nicer, but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions. only two of three elevators to top floors work -- and these two elevators skip floors, so you can be stuck waiting for ever. when i raised this to hotel staff, was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it. umm, no. this is not an old building problem, this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it. thumbs way down, stay away. go to the drake or knickerbocker if you're looking for old world charm, sans hassle.

"not impressed at all. the hotel itself looks really nice, especially in the big foyer area. our room was small, and the bathroom needed some major upgrades. it had the green tile, like at your grandmother's house, all over the walls, and 2 people couldn't fit in it if you tried. we could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning, so obvioulsy the walls aren't so thick. our room looked directly on to a brick building outside, very close, we couldn't even tell if it was nice outside or not. we are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it, and i felt yucky the whole time in it. i just wouldn't pay lots of money to stay here, there is nothing exceptional about it at all.

"we stayed two nights. we were registered by a very unfriendly desk attendant. he was very cold. our room was very, very small and the closet did not even hold the few clothes we packed for two days. the room was stylishly decorated but lacked the nice small touches such as an extra pillow in the closet. we were attracted to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level - however when we went to have a drink, the door to the bar was locked. we called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really wasn't and were told they were short staffed, 'sorry'. what?? are you running here? you are a hotel in the country's third largest city and your amenities are open at whim? this was our first and last visit to a kimpton hotel.

"to start with, this hotel had the worst customer service. they were impossible to work with on everything! now, the problems we had in chronological order. first, we arrive at 8 pm sat. to check in. they did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available, so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway (free of charge). however, the room was not ready yet. finally at 10.30! (2.5 hrs later) we were able to get our room keys. but, there was no rollaway. another 30 mins and 3 phone calls later, we had a rollaway, but had to get the charge waived a second time. now we go to check out on mon. and they couldn't print us a bill or give us a total. we stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn $2,127.00! we called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 times, for $709 each, when our bill was supposed to be $450. after sitting at the gas station on the phone for 1.5hrs, the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home. i would recommend a holiday inn over the intercontinental any day.

"we stayed in the amalfi in july 2010, 4th of july weekend. i was very apprehensive about leaving my diesel ford excursion with the valet at amalfi. it has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly. i explained the procedure to the valet drivers, and felt like it was a complete waste of time. when the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as i had instructed. when i tried to start it, it wasn't happy, but did finally start. i was so relieved to get it back i just wanted to leave. driving away i noticed that the top speed recorded on the gps was 105mph!!! (previous top speed was 95mph, done a few days earlier driving across south dakota). i could just picture the flying ferrari scene in ferris bueller's day off. i couldn't imagine where in the crowded chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast, though it wouldn't take long to make that happen (see reference to modified engine above). a little while later we stopped for lunch and i noticed a dent in the front bumper. i contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people. no remedy. lesson learned. brett

"check ins went smoothly. but be advised.... walls are super thin, the building is old and the rooms are very very very small. the downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out. for the price it wasn't bad. it was walking distance to most major attractions. overall ... it's ok at best. another plus is the cta is close by.

"as a frequent traveler to chicago, i generally stay at the sutton court, but thought i would try a different boutique hotel. i will never stay at this hotel again. the first room they brought me to -- their standard room -- was a glorified closet, leaving me absolutely claustrophobic! actually the smallest hotel room i've been in in the u.s! i complained to the front desk, who then moved me to a ""premium"" room -- still quite small, but manageably so. the bathroom was tiny, without a vanity, making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room. the location leaves much to be desired, as my room looked out directly onto the el (elevated subway - background noise), and the street was pretty deserted on a sunday evening. i will say that the free wi-fi was great. if you can find a chain or other hotel closer to michigan avene, i'd highly recommend you take that. if you want a nice room in a great location, check out sutton place hotel instead.

"i was really excited about staying at the amalfi after reading several reviews online. unfortunately, it was a very disappointing experience. when we arrived, we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold. so, we had to move to another hotel. amalfi did take care of the other hotel, cab fare, and after much negotiating...breakfast. we were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient. instead of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned, we had to get up, pack up our suitcases, check out of the hotel, take a cab, check back into the amalfi, only then could we head to the museum. we were also told that our first night's stay would be refunded. well, more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls later...there still hasn't been a refund. i can't even get a manager to call me back. the amalfi wasn't all bad, it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance. the coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers. however, it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended. one reason we picked the amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles, but they seemed really small for queens. our view from our room was of the alley. so, overall the best part of staying at the amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the 22nd floor. very disappointing indeed!

"arrived at 1:30am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel. if you party and stay out all night anyway, this hotel would be fine. but don't plan to get any rest if the club is open! front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while i was checking in. she was fine with me and gave me a corner room, but sure wouldn't want to be on her bad side.

"i usually stay at the hotel monaco but stayed at the allegro because most the monaco was booked. while the allegro is similar to the monaco in it's decor (less traditional and more funky interior) it is not nearly as nice. the linens are not as high quality as the monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice. the rooms are also smaller. the main reason i would not recommend the hotel though, is the bathroom. it has an old tiled floor, with an old sink, and old toilet. it reminds me of something you would find in a men's locker room. although the allegro has installed a nice mirror, it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance. also, the layout of the bathroom is terrible. the toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet. also, the room is not very clean as well. the floor in my room was dirty and i found crumbs in the drawers. i would recommend staying at the monaco, hard rock, or soffitel for a hotel that is a little less traditional but still nice.

"after reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel, i went ahead and got an ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness. i normally have a good experience with intercontinental hotels, particularly the mark hopkins in sf. i called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as ambassador club. when i arrived at the hotel, there was no separate check-in line (as advertised) and the manager on duty basically ignored me when i told him i was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room. i was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty. they gave me a room in the ""modern"" tower, (built in the 60's) which was about 2/3 the size of a regular room at the mark hopkins (built in '29). i had to deal with torn sheets, cracked marble sinks, and the spare roll of toilet paper being located outside the bathroom inside the closet - how convenient is that? the closet door, if you are not careful, may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door. i was not provided with a key to the minibar and i called for turndown service, which never happened. the next day, they finally got around to the fact that i was an ambassador club member and entitled to an upgraded room, but since i travel with a medical device which i already set up in the tiny room, i declined. to their credit, they did send some of the amenities i would otherwise be entitled to as an ambassador club member. i would not stay at this hotel next time i go to chicago. there are other better places for the money including, the omni, the james, the fairmont, hyatt, sheraton, monaco, crowne plaza, even the holiday inn and marriotts located in the same general area.

"we booked the amalfi looking for a great boutique hotel in chicago. the hotel is a nice property with clean rooms and nice amenities in a good location. however, when i booked the hotel i was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only $10 more. that was great until i checked in. the corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley. during the night there were several homeless individuals fighting in the alley. it would seem that this is a place for them to congregate. on top of this, the dumpsters in the alley were being emptied by the waste department between 5 and 6 am in the morning. the noise was crazy loud. i think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate aspects due to its location. the staff is extremely friendly and very helpful.

"i'm a frequent business traveler and often in chicago on trips. at times, it's very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown chicago, and this was one of those times. i recently had to pay almost $400 for one night at the allegro. it was absolutely not worth it. the hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers, so check-in and check-out were very slow. there were very few elevators, which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests. the morning i checked out, our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby, but the elevator was almost completely full when i got on at the 18th floor, so i can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs. the room was extremely small and cramped, even though it had obviously been renovated recently. the tv, bed, and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel. still, the rate was way overpriced for such a small room. the best thing about the allegro was the room service, which was prompt. the food was good, and the prices were very reasonable for room service. from now on, if my regular hotels are booked, i'll just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isn't worth it.

"booked through hotwire and consequently was placed in a room where we barely had room to walk around our luggage. the 'view' was of the 'inner courtyard' of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms. you were unable to determine what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night. they no longer have in-room coffee appliances. you either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room, or go around the corner to starbucks or mcdonald's. internet access is not free ($12.95/24 hours), the ""gift shop"" is a joke (tucked away in the corner of the coat check room, concierge services have limited hours, and the business center is open only during 'business hours' which made it difficult to get work done after 'business hours."" i would not stay there ever again, nor do i recommend it to anyone. i have had better stays at any holiday inn express!

"spent three nights in chicago at this property. first of all, i have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the magnificent mile close to terrific restaurants, the art institute and orchestra hall. the hotel has two sides - the historic tower and a new wing. the rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired. this property needs to be renovated. some observations: the junior suite i had was laid out strangely. a small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom. the mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right - made shaving a challenge and messy. while descending in the elevator one morning, it started shaking so violently that i could barely stand up. it stopped on the 11th floor and i was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down. (this experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up - an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness!) reports from my group were of sinks stopped up, exposed bolts in rooms, and generally things not working. now the good news - the staff is terrific. they make you feel welcome, are personable, have their own personalities, great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help. i wish they had a better property to work in.

"here are my experiences: - had three rooms reserved, when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms - screwed up initial room assignments, gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in - could not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty (we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys) - in room guide says pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th - could not get to the pool from the 14th floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th - when we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room. - when we received our bills, the credit card assignments were still wrong. i stay at ""economy"" hotels a lot and i have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one. this hotel should do chicago a service and just close its doors. due to this experience, i will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and surrounding business that are just as bad.

"i am usually a big fan of kimpton hotels, but this place is awful !!! i would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. it is an old, dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more ""botique"" . the carpets are dirty, and tattered; patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet. yuck!!! the bathrooms are tiny, and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them. when we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned, we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way. we woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table. we told the front desk, called housekeeping, and then called the front desk again..finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum. the elevators are slow, and often only one is working at any given time. i did not find the staff to be friendly at all, except for one waiter @ breakfast. what a disappointment :(

"ok, i just feel if you're paying well over $200 for a room you should get something to show for it. the location was on michigan ave but if i pay just a little more i could have had way better (peninsula, park hyatt, shoot the omni was 10x better). we ordered a deluxe executive suite, and it was so below sub par. the room was very small (so small the ice bucket was in the closet), the bathroom was just as small, just well lit (a plus). wallpaper was peeling, outlets barely covered, no view. the only thing appealing was the bed, and that may have been because i was so tired. and we were really excited because this is the palmer house. the palmer house does have nice restaurants: the lockwood (quiet, distinguished) and the potter's lounge (grown/sexy)

"i am writing in regards to our stay april 22-24. we were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay. there was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay. my husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrival...it wasn't. when he called to place the order again, it never showed up. we were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time. our room was very small, drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for. we had called to request a room with a large tub, similar to the ones in the photos, prior to our arrival, noting that we didn't mind an upgrade cost. instead, the tub was incredibly small. we have stayed at the intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the chicago location, especially considering we were celebrating such a happy, once-in-a-lifetime occasion. the service and amenities just didn't match up.

"used this hotel the first time i was in chicago. for the prices and for being classified an intercontinental...i wouldn't consider it that good. the rooms were solid. the view was ok (but so is it virtually everywhere else on michigan ave.) the service was ok. the prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else. we came here for a jewish/hindi wedding. appetizer was fine. main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else. dessert was inedible. i have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it. i personally preferred the conrad. better prices and better service.

"the historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel. unfortunately, the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings. the front desk staff was rude, the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door. there are three elevators but good luck with them all working. they are very very small and when only one is up and running...you end up waiting a long time for one. not fun when you are on the 12th floor. the room was tiny and the air conditioning did not work at all...the room felt damp and miserable. we put the thermostat as low as it would let us (65) and the room never went below 78. (and it was 107 outside the whole trip!!!). there really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant. internet is not free either... overall, i would never stay here again.

"we stayed here for one night, and found it a hotel that concentrates on conferences rather than your normal guest. we found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the odds for this - @ $200 for the night. we felt when we checked in that if you weren't with the conference, then why were we staying in the hotel. the guy at the main door didn't even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby, we then had to que for 15-20 minutes just to check in. we were not given any information about the hotel and when i rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that i could access the internet through, i was just short of being asked why didn't i bring my lap-top with me so i could use the internet access in the room.... !! i found the staff very rude and not helpful at all and would not recommend this hotel for a tourist.

"our suite at the knickerbocker are quite nice, but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal. first, a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present. not a tremendous problem, but when the young woman at the front desk replied ""what do you want me to do about it"" with the tone of a flippant teenager, i began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff. fast forward to this evening. following a lovely meal off the premises, we chose to turn in a bit early at 11:30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions, the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. acting prudently and with restraint, we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs, but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel, and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume. on one hand i appreciated his honesty, but on the other, i truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. since we're out of options for the evening, we've decided to stay up and try to watch tv for the time being, but given the circumstances, the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. also, i was alarmed to learn that while i slept the prior night, a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property. this wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels, the knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. would i stay here again? maybe on a dare, or if someone else was footing the bill. yet i've had better experiences in road side motels, and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests, and more importantly simple common sense.

"i have traveled to chicago many times for business, and so i have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons. there was nothing dramatically wrong the sheraton, but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel. it almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs. the carpets were old, there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom, towels and linens were older than i expected, the rooms were in need of some redecorating, etc. during the week i was paying $349 per night for a room, and it simply was not near the quality i expected for that price. one positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good. plenty of aerobic machines with tvs, weights, etc. location is also quite good (perhaps the reason for the high price) with close walks to michigan avenue and the river. in summary, i think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown chicago.

"i booked a hotel room for 4 nights at this hotel through an online vendor. after booking the hotel room i contacted the hotel to request a room with 2 beds. i was told in 3 different conversations with hotel personnel that i would have a room with 2 double beds. when i arrived i was given a king sized bed and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do for myself and my 3 guests. apparently the hotel management saw no problem with 4 people sleeping in 1 bed. the staff was completely unaccomodating. to add insult to injury we met other guests that had obtained a room with 2 beds by just walking in off the street the day after we checked in. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone. the customer service is well below what is acceptable. the location of the hotel is great but there are many other hotels that offer excellent service and high quality rooms to stay in while visiting chicago. bottom line is do not stay at the millenium knickerbocker!!!

"while this is a good location for shopping and sightseeing, i would not recommend this hotel to anyone. the rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny, all of which is to be expected in an old urban hotel, but apparently care has not been given to updating the hotel (ever!). the crown molding and base boards are cracked and it appears to only have been painted over and over again. the newer tub liner in the bathroom is merely floating above the old tub and when you stand in the shower it bubbles under your feet. the shower tiles are old and the grout is not clean. this hotel has not been restored the updating that has been done are merely band-aides. there is no fan exhaust in the bathroom and the carpet is ontop of a very hard surface, probaly concrete with no pad in between. the lobby is smokey because of the large open bar in the small space. we were in town on business and supposed to stay 4 nights, we left after 2 and went to another hotel.

"the location of this hotel is excellent. the hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say - in my opinion. the room decor is horrible (probably more european than i am used to) and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment. on the upside, if you want to stay in a great location, feel safe, and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work. i prefer westin or marriott...something that you can count on.

"my wife and i stayed here for a weekend in chicago and had an okay experience. the location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown chicago hotel. everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in chicago means a taxi ride. the other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere. i don't necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby, the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere. the pool/spa/excercise room was not very impressive either. it is accessible by walking through the business center corridor, wondering if you're going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small. there is also no hot tub and the ""spa"" is a closet with a massage table. the concierge was helpful but the people that answer the ""sheraton promise"" phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors. the beds were super comfortable. i think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do much better in downtown chicago.

"rude, rude, rude! we stayed here on july 4th weekend. we drove from michigan, we called customer service to get directions from i-95 w/c is a major highway to chicago-- calling them from a cellphone, telling them we're in a middle of a storm and that we're lost....we were put on hold, forwarded to another person who did not know how to get to the hotel and we were on hold again. giving up we decided to just exit the highway and try our luck at a 7-11 store. when we finally arrived at the hotel at 2 am no one was there to take care of our car so we looked for parking ourselves. checking in we were not greeted by anyone, even the receptionist did not greet us!! no welcome to the knickerbocker, nothing! the man at the reception was rude, which makes me think what kind of customer service training this hotel has. the guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are checking-in at 2 am!! well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier. the room is not even spectacular, very small, probably a little bigger than a walk-in closet. stay here at your own risk.

"i stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in mid-march and was so disappointed with everything. the room was small, the carpets in the looby were smelly, no bathtub in the washroom and view of brick walls from the windows. not even free internet which even the cheapest hotels offer these days. it costs $10/day to connect to internet. if you want to use internet in the lobby, minimum charge is $5 per use. to use the phone in the rooms for local calls, it is $1.25/15mins and then 10 cents every min. even the local calls are charged, what a rip off!!! every hotel i have stayed at offers free intercontinetal breakfast, of course no such thing at this hotel. no indoor pool, go figure. i won this from bidding process at priceline, i will be reluctant to use this service and this hotel in future.

"after staying at the sheraton royal orchid hotel in bangkok, i was expecting a similar experience at the chicago sheraton. i had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a repeat experience. unfortunately, my expectations were not met. for the past 3 years i stayed at the palmer house in the loop, but thought i'd try a more modern hotel. pros - location by the chicago river, two blocks from michigan avenue - restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work environment - buffet breakfast offering custom omelettes, crepes and french toast cons - check-in assigned me to a city view room when i had prepaid for a river view room - river view was good, but the windows to see it were filthy - dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door - bathroom was unimpressive: bathtub-shower combination; worn plumbing fixtures; only 2 sets of towels provided - guest room was small: only one soft chair provided - guest room doors slammed noisily throughout the floor hallway - 7 to 8 block walk to nearest l-station - concierge couldn't explain how to get to the mercury theatre, nor print a map of the area - guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the link cafe - no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room - no final billing folio delivered to the room on the night before check-out - not all computers were operational at the link cafe where boarding passes can be printed

"this hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years. the first room they gave us was a shock. tiny and the bathroom was a joke,, you had to step inside, move out of the way just to shut the door. the furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was very beat up and painted over about 100 times. so they transfered us to the 'executive suite' that room had a tiny bathroom.. i mean tiny! the furniture was hideous and dirty. it was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud. the only impressive part is the lobby.. but don't be fooled. because after that .. the floors above look like they need a major overhaul.. and the rooms were not worth even $100 per night. we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through priceline deal. i don't think we want to do priceline again only because they have the knickerbocker as a 4 star hotel and we don't ever want to go back there again. 2 stars at best for the dumpy knickerbocker. they should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms. boomer. naperville, il

"the lobby of the homewood is right down the hall from the kitchen and dining room(actually more of a grade school cafeteria type set up). the odors from the kitchen were disgusting, and indeed reminded my of that of a institutional kitchen(i.e. hospital). the free breakfast and free dinner were not at all palatable. i suppose that if you are traveling with a young family as many guests were, that makes this hotel a good value. but i would not stay here again.

"swisses chicago: nice, but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the chicago waterfront. a spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city, but don't plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning. no free wifi here ,or affordable breakfast, or a free swim in the pool. just a ten-dollar-a-night charge for internet, an on average $25 plate for breakfast, and another 15 bucks a night for the ""fitness center."" i've stayed in small town no star motels where wifi is free as part of a 50 dollar room. get with it - this is 2009! no free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and don't need it anyway, but for those of us who aren't charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated. coffee, milk, oj; stale donuts, ,muffins, maybe some cereal. throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby. with regards to swimming, this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly. this all makes the $6 fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain. summation: drop the fees, the nickel dimming of folks, and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel.

"i choose the homewood suites in downtown chicago because i called them directly in search of a two bed room within walking distances of the attractions of chicago. well, when we arrived, it was apparent that there was chaos do to one of two elevators being out of service (which it had been since tuesday, this was saturday). once we finally got to the 6th floor to check in, i figured our relaxing time had begun. well, we got our room key and headed for the17th floor. again, waited for an elevator but finally made it two our room. i put the key in the door it opened to the surprise of me and the family already inside the room - yup we got double booked. the family was very nice and seemed ok with their surprise visitors. said our apologies and went back to the elevator and waited again to head back down to the 6th floor registration to figure the mess out. we have now been at the hotel for a half hour with no room and slightly annoyed. made it to the reservation desk and explained the situation. i did get an apology and a new room. new key in hand waited again for an elevator to bring us to the 9th floor for a new room. finally got to our room only to find it was a king suite. we are a family of four including two full grown teenage boys. there was no way they were going to fit on a pull out sofa. so, really annoyed now, i called the front desk and was told that were no rooms with two beds left even though i had specifically asked for two beds when i booked. it said two beds on preference on my reservation but the reservation agent assured me two beds would be available when i checked in. she went so far to but two beds on my reservation paper work. the operator said there are is only one two bed room on each floor. the only thing we got was a fold up bed that took away half the room in the living area. now, i paid a total of 349.00 for one night for this room. we got the mess mentioned above and a breakfast out of the deal. i am pretty sure my next trip to chicago will not include this hotel. i can tell you that we are frequent hws/hilton customers but this hotel will not be on our list of stops in the future.

"this review has two parts. . .i advise reading both. chapter one: the actual hotel and staff i found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating. the room was nice and clean as well. i have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff. this is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the south to reach the riverfront, or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the north. very easy (one block) walk from the subway (red line). the morning complimentary breakfast is substantial. not just muffins and coffee. you can have a complete breakfast here if you want. and, even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient. i would recommend this hotel if based solely on the physical location, the room, and the staff. chapter two: the nightmare i booked this room through central reservations in july for a mid-september arrival. the rate was quoted to me as $159 per night for four nights. when the confirmation was emailed to me, it was incorrect by over $300. i immediately called the hotel. they said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount. i did receive the corrected confirmation email. . .all done? no. one week later, my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged. i called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve. when i explained the error, i was literally called a liar by the person in reservations, and told ""that's not my problem. i can't help you"". . . and then told that i have to pay the higher amount. excuse me? now, i go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance. after a few left messages, i get the general manager to call me back, and discuss the issue. after taking down all of the names of people i spoke with, he assures me that he will credit the account immediately. i even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc. . . one week later, still no credit. so, i call the general manager again. oh, this might take up to 72 hours to process, i am told. so, please give it another week. another week passes, still no credit. so another call to the manager. i am told now that the credit has been processed, and he even sends me an email confirming our ""agreement"" for the credit, just to appease me. another week passes. still, not seeing that credit that was ""definitely processed"" a week ago. yet another call to the general manager on the day before i am to leave on my trip to chicago. i told him i will be arriving, and at this point, i want to see him personally, and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while i am there. remember, we are now talking six weeks and this is still not resolved. i arrive at the hotel, and to make a long story short, the general manager was never available to see me, nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me. the only person i spoke face to face with, was the assistant general manager. he was completely unconcerned with my situation, and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of ""you realize this boils down to a matter of 'he said she said'"". . . what???? today, my trip is over, and i have flown back home. i still have not received the credit to my account!!! i will absolutely be reporting all of this to hilton corporate customer service, and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point. take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel.

"i booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the magnificent mile christmas lights parade. i chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed. we arrived at our hotel around 3:30 pm to check in. we came at this time because the front desk worker said that we could not check in until 3:00 pm. after giving him our name, the manager said,""ok, we have your king smoking suite available"". we quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a non-smoking room. he insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room. we went back and forth, then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation. luckily, we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone. it clearly said non-smoking. after showing him our reservation, he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available. so why in the world did he need to see our reservation!! we decided to see if we could handle the smoking room. it turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children. the manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed. we canceled our room reservation. we live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home. my family was very disappointed. my husband is a gold member with hilton. let's just say we will be switching back to marriott. the hotel lobby was dated. the smoking room that i saw looked very dated as well. they made an error and never owned up to it, nor did they do anything to compensate us for such a huge inconvenience.

"generally speaking, nothing bad about that place if there would not be the cleaning issue. we checked the closed with the mini bar (picture uploaded), so much dust, nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years. we called in housekeeping, giving them the opportunity to check and do something about it. still the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs. later. next day moved to a renovated room, much better but not 5 star clean at all. in addition, there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception, no wonder when just 1/3 of the counters is actually open. please do something about these issues its ruining everything!

"we planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip. i booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast - get a quick bite, then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff. well, our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly, and thankfully, switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights. the room was dirty. when we opened the sofabed, the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out. ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used, and theoretically cleaned, a lot. extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms weren't much better. temperature control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night, it made for a cold stay. if you like to eat for free (they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights) and don't care to eat the great food chicago has to offer, i guess some may find this place tolerable. but we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a golden corral. the only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area (we switched to the james and had a great experience). i couldn't be paid to stay here again. i'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience.

"stayed valentines weekend. got the 5th floor with a direct view of the building next door. you have to pay extra for the pool and the ice machine was out on our floor. parking nearby sucks as most of chicago or pay 50 for valet to go through your car. glasses were dusty and gross. this location is notorious for having super sensitive scales on the mini fridge, so when you barely touch it you'll get a bill at 3 in the morning under your door. had i been on a higher floor and had a better view it would be a 4 star but not this time.

"we stayed at the swissotel for a three day weekend, and were disappointed to see the construction when we arrived. is it just me, or is this information not clearly stated on their website? a giant tarp where a lobby should have been was pretty weird and unwelcoming. the room itself was fine. more bland and generic than the ""european elegance"" claimed on their website. the lack of hot water, was definitely not fine though. there were a couple pluses to our stay at swissotel. the location is good, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. these few good points certainly did not redeem our experience, and i wouldn't pick this place again, even post-construction.

"firtly they took $372 off my card, even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night. they had no business taking the money off of my card. so on the 28th sep i contacted them and they admited to the mistake. it is not a month later and i have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back. secondly i booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel. when i looked a week later, they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate, so two of my friends didn't come to the trip away. thirdly i asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken asap as the dollar was weak against the pound. after about 8 phone calls over 5 months (each saying they would) they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional ps150. overall, the hotel was nice and in a nice location, but i will never be staying there again due to all my problems.

"i would not recommend staying at the swissotel in chicago. i was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times. she had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since i would be arriving first. the ""night manager"" at the hotel was extremely rude and told me i could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation. (this was their mistake) they told me i could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived. they did nothing to try and help me until i stood there and complained for twenty minutes. i can't believe that a ""manager"" would treat a customer this way. there are other great hotels in chicago. this hotel is not worth the aggravation!

"ideal location right in the heart of the near north side but good grief, they need more than two elevators. you can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor (registration desk on 6th floor), you can face a long line just to catch one. rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all homewood suites - very utilitarian; unlike many locations however, this one does not include a dvd player in the rooms. the pool is ok but there's no jacuzzi. oh, and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area. front desk service is pretty good.

"my fiance and i traveled to chicago for the first time this december and we were not happy with this hotel. the friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys. they greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay. the rest of the staff however was terrible. when we first checked in, i was instantly discouraged. the front desk person was not in a good mood and i couldn't wait to leave the lobby. having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing. we asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations. we felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff. at one point, the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her, as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well. even though she saw us standing there, after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first. yes, we are in our mid 20's, but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible. for how much money we paid for each night, i would have rather stayed somewhere else. we decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews, but we did not experience any of this during our stay. the rooms were alright, but nothing special. i would not stay in this hotel again.

"the elevator system was impossible. it seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse. many people waited 15+ minutes and some bailed out to the stair wells. it happened several times. i had read about it before booking but guess i didn't take it seriously. it'd be a deal breaker for any future return unless i heard clearly it was improved. also, i always think it's lame that you have to pay extra for wifi. area recommendations north michigan avenue and lake front areas are best.

"as a frequent traveler for work, i stay at many spg properties. compared to all the spg property in chicago, this is by far the worst. why? 1) they charge you to use the gym. $12 per day or something like $24 for your entire stay. i can't even begin on what a rip off that is. 2) as a gold or platinum member, you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room. they do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one. 3) they do not have wireless internet. it is 2010- enough said. to charge you at least over $200 a night, all the above amenities should be built into that cost. i would never stay here again.

"very very noisy - constant water running through pipes. it was terrible!! there are much better hotels to stay at in chicago. thier parking rate is obnoxious ($42.00 a night) and way too far out to walk to much. if you must stay here, try to park for free on dead end street (feed meter on weekdays) and take the stairs down to the next street level and you will find a jewel grocery store for sodas/snacks. (a can of soda at the hotel was $4.50 plus 18% restocking fee!!)

"we went to chicago for my 2nd wedding anniversary and stayed at homewood. my first impression was great, very helpful valet employees and very nice. that is one perk of my stay here. otherwise, we had no problems checking in other than the hotel has 19 floors and when we booked the room we asked that we have the highest room avalible due to the fact that it was my husband first time there and the higher up, the more beautiful the view is. so we got the 9th floor. not what i call ""high up"" when the rooms started on floor 6. then the following morning, we went to breakfast of which was ok, nothing great. my husband and i went down in jeans and a sweatshirt but had not really thought about shoes as we thought it would just be a few bagles, some fruit, and that was it. so, we got our food and sat down. after getting stared at for the first 15-20 minutes, an employee came and told us that we wernt allowed to eat breakfast without our shoes on. remind you, it was about 15-20 minutes after we had even entered the room. so she asked that we go get shoes while sitting down and eating our breakfast. pretty pointless after we already had gotten our food. i am sure it is because very few employees could speak understandable english that it took so long. last but not least, dont come with a clean car. i had washed my car one day prior to arriving there and when it was returned, it was filthy dirty.

"my wife and i frequently stay downtown for a night in the city. we have been to many hotels in the downtown chicago area. my opinion of the swissotel - spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience. the swissotel has a very 'cold' atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable. the room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average. the view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel. other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more. our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at 8:00a which woke us up. we called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk. we also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel. they said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register. he didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment. overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment. spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off michigan avenue for real top notch service. anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area.

"i called the reservations line to book a room at the beginning of december 2012 for a rate with a local corporation. when i first made the reservation i did not get an e-mail confirmation. i had to call again to get the e-mail and then saw that i was booked in a handicapped accessible room which i did not need as there was me, my wife and three year old. i called the reservation line and asked for a regular room which they said was impossible at the rate i was at, however for ten dollars more i can upgrade to a regular room. i then asked what if a disabled person needs the room and he said he could not help me. i told them to cancel the room. based on the reservation experience, i did not want to run into anymore trouble at this hotel.

"even though the reviews of this hotel are very good, the only good thing about it is the location, which is excelent. aside from that, there are only 2 elevators, so there is always a wait to get in. they also seem to have insufficient staff so getting your luggage, room service, etc takes forever. even if you arrive in a cab, there is no space to load/unload so you have to block the street while you arrive/depart, the rooms seem a bit dated and in need of a refresh. all in all, there are much better options in chicago

"the hotel is staffed by very nice but many inexperienced people. executive lounge has limited hours and no access outside of those hours. other areas similarly lack the level of service that is expected for this type of hotel. one of the individuals at the concierge desk twice gave us bad information about public transportation and the hours at one place. while the location is good, this particular hotel is simply not a good representation of what swissotel is supposed to be, and there are far better choices in chicago. it would not be my choice for a return stay.

"two main issues: (1) understaffed from the street to the front desk. unfortunately i had to drive into the city, when i arrived there was an excessively long wait for parking. then inside, there was a huge queue line with just one clerk working in a big city hotel. not good (i will say friendly however) (2) i know this is a big city, but, $49 a night to park my car when i'm staying at that hotel? really?? that's unreasonable and a bit gouging in my opinion. again, i realize this is chicago, but, i'm already paying a hefty price for this outdated hotel.

"we travel to chicago frequently and have stayed in many of the hotels downtown. we were excited to try the swissotel, but left disappointed. the actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views, the staff was extremely rude. the man that checked us in was on the phone and did not acknowledge us until he was done with his phone call. he then did not say more than five words, which were ""i need a credit card"". the lobby bar had fireplaces and was very cozy. the hotel information said it closed at 2am so we came back to hotel at 1230am for a ""night cap"", that was last call. that was fine for us, but the bar was full and many people were coming back from their night wanting a ""night cap"" but did not make last call. our night ended listening to many unhappy people complaining and receiving no sympathy from the employees. there are many places to stay in the area that are just as nice or nicer, no need to stay at the swissotel again. definitely don't stay if you're looking for a romantic weekend away, the employees will ruin your experience from the second you walk in the door.

"i stayed here for 5 nights last summer. i booked the reservation on priceline for $75/night which was the cheapest rate i could find anywhere during a convention week. anyway, when i arrived at 11 pm from the airport, i was told that they had overbooked the hotel and had no room for me. they booked me at a dumpy 2 star motel by the airport. they gave me $20 for a taxi to get there, and it cost me $35. i was late for a meeting the next morning because of the extra travel and packing/unpacking. the millennium offered no compensation whatsoever for their foul-up. no free drink, no room upgrade, nothing. since i booked on the internet, i was chopped liver. beware.

"we stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters duing a part business, part family fun trip in july. we were very impressed with the location, within walking distance to great restraunts and shopping, inlcuding water tower place (a great mall!). we were quite disappointed with the room cleanlinees and size. the bedspreads were filthy and so thin. the room decor is in dire need of an upgreade. the bathroom had no fan and it really smelled badly of mold and mildew. the shower actually had mold in the corners! this was a very tight squeese for 4 people. especially the bathroom. the beds and pillows were quite uncomfortable. even the elevators were tiny and could barely fit 6 people! thank goodness there were a few elevators. luckily we booked this room on priceline and would have never paid full price. the only upside was the great location. also beware- its cheaper to take a taxi to the airport than the airport shuttle! millenium promotes the airport shuttle but take a cab!

"i stayed at the sheraton as it was where a conference i was attending was being held. on the plus side, the hotel is reasonably well located, within a few minutes walk of michigan avenue. my room had a superb view out over the river. however, for the price i must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment. the decor was dated, and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty. the wifi is ridiculously expensive, and frustratingly as a conference delegate i was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access. there was no wifi in the conference rooms, although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails. i know chicago is expensive, but for that price i feel the experience should have been better.

"well, this used to be a le meridian hotel, and it has changed for the worse. we kept having to remind them we booked a package, because we were being over-charged separately for everything, when it should have been included. we were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival, and did not. two phone calls and three hours later, it finally showed up. we tried to have a drink in the bar, and even though we were the only people there, three servers/bartenders came and went, talking to each other, not one of them acknowledging us. after ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink. and don't bother to pay extra for ""city view""; because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor, looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall - that is all we could see. oh yes, the valet lost his cell phone in someone's car, and called me at home today to see if we found it. he wanted me to call him back at home. nice of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff, huh? for the money, stay at any other hotel in chicago with the same price-point and it will be much much better.

"not a good start when the front desk isn't willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room! we reserved a king suite, and the hotel put us in a queen suite without telling us up front. only after we confronted the manager did they come clean about the switch, he offered us a free breakfast, but would not up-grade our room. the whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the omni. we will not be retuning to this hotel again.

"thank god i got this hotel through priceline. i can't imagine paying full price for this place. the tub was moldy and dingy. the toilet didn't flush. their selection of tv channels was limited to say the least. unless you wanted to pay $5 for a rerun of an nbc show. oh, and internet? why that will set you back about $15 for the day. and breakfast? that's about $16 for a cup of coffee, a croissant and two slices of honeydew. this hotel is the pits. the customer service is....absent! when you walk in to the ridiculous lobby (decked out like some bad late 80's prom) there's no one to direct you upstairs to the check in. and once you're there, check in is very fast, i'll grant them that. this hotel is a big, crummy rip-off. i will never stay here (and will steer clear of hyatts in general i believe).

"my expectations were not high because i booked this hotel through priceline for $58 / night. an amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait 15 - 20 minutes for hot water. i called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water - to which they nonchalantly replied: ""try running it for 15 to 20 minutes."" they forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower, if anyone else expected to use the shower. my boyfriend, who showered after me, had to wait another 10 minutes to get the shower warm again. to make matters worse, after room service was delivered, we called and said we needed another fork. they told us it would cost $3 ($1 for the fork, $2 for delivey charge). absolutely ridiculous!! at least with a 1 star hotel, you get hot water. this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel. i guess you do get what you paid for - i just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price.

"complete disappointment. problems: 1. the alarm clock/stereo thing was broken in my room. it was constantly emitting low, changing hissing noises. sooo annoying. and there was no off switch on the damn thing. i had to move the bed to unplug it (the outlet was wayyy back, buried behind the big bed). i kept hearing it, and didn't realize what it was, until it had kept me awake for a few hours. 2. the shower was only incredibly hot. turn it all the way cold...very hot. turn it to hot, and you get boiling hot. grrrrreat. so how do i get water that won't scald me? this is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry, and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water. good job omni! 3. hallway carpets are disgusting and old. walking around, you'd think you're in a motel 6. and my floor had been flooded or something, and they had box fans running in the hallway, 24/7, to try to dry it out. talk about an overpriced dump.

"this hotel is very busy and is operating way beyond their means. incompetent service. hotel ran out of hot water by 9am saturday. elevators were very slow, waited 10 minutes on any given event. red line trains ran every 10 minutes beneath city streets and you can hear the thunder in your room from them but it shouldnt keep you awake at night. used my stay toward nw airlines bonus points. bar was ok. one cup coffee service was awful. no free wireless and no free cable channels. fridge was 25 bucks a day to use. with http://hotels.com res got it for 65 bucks with tax so what can you expect.?.... location was superb and cab service was convenient but not enough to outweigh the negatives.

"it's so frustrating when a hotel posts a deal prominently on its website, claiming said deal is available on certain dates. but, when you call to make a reservation based on that deal, they tell you it's not available. there are rooms available, but not the deal. then they try to condescendingly tell you they can only sell so many rooms at such a deal. i get that. then just say that on the website. ""here's a great deal . . . but only a small number of people will actually get it."" so much for the great reviews about service . . . i couldn't even get past the first phone call without being frustrated and annoyed. bad form, conrad, bad form.

"i live in chicago and have frequent occasion to recommend hotels to friends and business acquaintances. we recently put up a candidate (and his family) we were recruiting for our company at the conrad. we had had good luck with this hotel when it was a le meridien. it was a disappointment for all concerned as a conrad. on the plus side, our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room. on the downside... they learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub (only a shower). our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it, which they had to clean themselves. when the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some, they were told it would be delivered immediately. when they called 30 minutes later the front desk admitted that they had ""forgotten."" while the concierge and doorman were quite helpful, our guests told us that the front desk personnel were sullen and unresponsive. our guests were generally under whelmed by one of the ""five best hotels in chicago."" conrad has a long way to go to compete with the four seasons, peninsula and park hyatt.

"maybe it was because we booked thru priceline that we were treated like second rate guest - couldn't get a room thru fairmont website as busy weekend with ryder cup.....but never have had this experience in using priceline before. the night time check in girl was rude and unhelpful. we were told no options to pay for upgrade or king bed and that we were stuck with two tiny beds and a ugly room. we had comforter with dirt in several places - and a bathroom for handicap with no counter space - had to use ironing board for toiletries. this hotel is huge and not at capacity - may have had a renovation but the good look of this hotel stops at the lobby. hallways, rooms, carpet run down - just not what you come to expect of a fairmont. i have stayed in many all over the world and this is by far the worst. maybe because we were on a low floor it was not updated...we paid as much as other guest and i'm a fairmont gold member. positives - great location, daytime staff helpful at desk - they have two bikes to borrow which is handy. views could be great if you get a higher room. checked out the raddison blu across street - looked much nicer!!!

"i travel often for business and this hotel ranks very low on my list. the room had such a strong odor of smoke, it gave me a headache (and i used to be a smoker)! the room service was mediocre and extremely expensive. the hotel is disturbingly huge. very difficult to navigate your way around it. i waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located. she curtly gave me cross-street names and hung up. uhhhhh, how do i know which direction to go in??? stains on the carpet in the room. a big gauge in the wall, where maybe a thermostat once was??? the shower is decent. all in all, for the price they charge, no thanks!!! i'm just glad my company is footing the bill.

"the location of the hotel is great, right on the river and michigan ave. almost everything is within walking distance. at the price, though, and given the 4 star hotel, we expected better walls. our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors. the sound from both rooms came in loud and clear. we heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone (he clearly wasn't speaking loudly), and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk. we asked them to be quiet (i shouldn't have expected that to work with some young drunks) then called security, but they did nothing. i was completely annoyed with the noise, especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one. unless you are in chicago to party, get drunk, and not get any sleep, i wouldn't stay here.

"i was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late september, and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle, but affected me and my husband. for example, he got locked out of our room 2 times, once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa. the other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony, so that was stressful because he lost some time. the keycard just would stop working. then a fuse blew, so we had no power while trying to get ready. it happened to me also, coming back from the spa, and i called on the hallway phone to get help. luckily, right after that, an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if i had been waiting long--as if she knew this was a problem. i said no, and she called down to check. apparently, no one had even called security to get me back into my room! she had a set of keys and let me in, thank god. then, on our wedding night, my husband wanted to order from room service. it was a little after 10:30pm. we were told that room service was closed for the night--even though all the literature in the room brags about ""24 hour dining."" that fact was never communicated to us when we checked in. i feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping. we later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off, so maybe that's why people weren't too intersted in providing good service. i don't think if i would recommend that anyone stay at this fairmont nor will i ever again. btw, the spa is great to hang out in, even if you're not doing a massage.

"we choose to stay at the hotel due to the high rooftop ratings at the hotel. not only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor, but it was occuppied with private corporate events for the entire duration of our stay. we did - as recommended - have a drink indoors only to be highly insulted by their bartender there. there is no breakfast buffet - you order a la carte. keep that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet. also note that the minibar is empty on arrival - we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order. we have stayed at the omni before and it as a much better experience. i dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel.

"the conrad hilton recently took over this property from the failed meridian hotel. it seems that the conrad has inherited a hotel property that just doesn't work. the entrance is very difficult to find. there are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby. as a result, there was often a line waiting for them. the same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area. if you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay, you will find the poor elevator layout annoying. the king room is what i would consider small compared to other chicago hotels. although i like modern design, the room was quite stark and cold. it was also showing quite a bit of wear and tear. the bathroom was the best part. has anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk? it was the most uncomfortable set-up i've experienced. the views are non-existent for most of the rooms. in a city with amazing vistas, this was disappointing. i saw a couple walking the halls with management trying to find a room that was acceptable to them. room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay. excellent food and high quality presentation. sorry i couldn't write a better review. would i stay here again? no. chicago has some incredible hotels and this is not one of them.

"our trip was our annual anniversary trip. the hotel did not honor my choice of king size bed. instead we received two double beds. this seriously decreased our enjoyment of our stay at the hyatt. there were two cups of coffee complimentary in the room. no complimentary coffee anyplace else in the very large hotel. location was more of a business district, not appropriate for pleasure trip. employees of hyatt were very friendly and helpful, other than the failure to deliver the reserved room.

"the hotel is well located, but the service is poor. they seem to cater to large conventioneers, with service more like a moderate chain hotel - not your typical fairmont. there are too many specifics to outline here, let's just say that from the front desk, to the spa, room service which only got my order correct one-day, to housekeeping which didn't even clean my room one day (although they sent a manager to inspect the room because the housekeeper said she did clean the room. yep, that's just what you want to come home to after 10 hrs of meetings! they did offer me a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience! the hotel is large and many times between 5-7 pm there would literally be a long line of guests waiting for an elevator. i've stayed at this fairmont twice. the 1st time i attended a conference nearby and the last time l chose it for the price. but it's not worth enduring such poor service. that was the last time for me.

"i was expecting an experience comparable to my stays at the olympia in seattle. the decor and overall feel of the hotel was much above average but not inspiring. biggest disappointment was the inadequate internet connection in the room. the wireless was very slow and the hard-wire from the wall did not work at all. i did request a replacement of the wall wire, but it did no help. this hotel can do better than this. with a 5 star rating, it should be an experience to be pleasantly remembered -- but, was just a mediocre experience for me. even the bed covers were not that special. needs more intense management. next time, i will try the trump facility thanks

"the omni was chosen for it's location whichworked out perfectly. the bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean ...until...i sat down in the tub...there was black mold in the soap holder, in the cracks on the walls between the tile, all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl. needless to say i drained the tub and took a shower...i really don't care for showers. oh yes...the toilet leaked as well...the staff were very helpful but i was disappointed. i travel extensively and don't think i will return. we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken, so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel, printed the presentation and delivered it to our room. they try! we booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another building...but we weren't there too much.

"i gave the conrad a second try at impressing me and it failed miserably. the hotel will not honor room requests. i expressed this was for a special occasion and would love a room with a view on my reservation. i got there and my 'view' was of the adjacent office building windows. i didn't pay nearly $400 a night for that. i called down and the manager was absolutely rude. ""that would've required you to pay at least $40 more.."" rude. lots and lots of mistakes happened. requested pillows were never sent up, the television sound was not functioning (i.e. no sound), when telling the manager of the problems he was horribly condescending and cared very little. i've had better service at a hampon inn! when they screwed up our breakfast vouchers i had to physically go down and question it.. they said ""we will send them right up"".. no, that never happened. absolutely ridiculous. the bathroom has always been nice, and the room had been renovated since i was there last year (thank the lord!)... it had a nice ambiance to it. the bed was quite nice as well. the valet guys were fantastic, probably the nicest men within that entire hotel. also the bellman, and housekeepers were wonderfully sweet and always said ""hi"" or ""hope you have a wonderful day"".. i appreciated that. perhaps the management team needs to go back to training school to learn about customer service. breakfast at the conrad restaurant is to be avoided completely. the service was abysmally inept, and not to mention slow. we had two different watresses and it took upward of 15 minutes just to get our juice. they looked like they hated their jobs, and treated us with the same attitude. we were never checked on after the food came. the food is overpriced and the quality is severely lacking. i got a continental breakfast and it included a muffin (burnt), a small croissant, and a tiny cinnamon roll. 14 dollars for that. laughable. or if you choose, for 14 dollars you can get some toast and juice! spare yourself and choose to eat elsewhere where you can get an actual tasty meal for your money. overall, the managers need to learn what customer service means, and how to bend over backwards for a customer. otherwise your business will crumble. and the conrad has crumbled for me. i spent way too much money on terrible service. i've already sent my opinions to hilton headquarters. i'll be looking at other hotels the next time im in chicago.

"this hotel was chosen by my husband's company as the family came along for the business trip. the location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and aquarium from the 34th floor. my first impressions were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean. the lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance, but was otherwise ok. lots of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long. seemed like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there. i had read from another reviewer to join the fairmont president's club and wi-fi in the room would be free. we signed up for the club, but were puzzled as to why they don't just offer everyone free wi-fi. parking fees were exorbitant at $58/night, but thankfully the company was paying for this. we were able to walk to millennium park and navy pier from our hotel. the hotel is not kid-friendly in terms of restaurants or amenities. there is no swimming pool, but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the swissotel next door (there is an underground tunnel that connects the fairmont there). we loved the swissotel's pool on the 42nd floor. fantastic views from the pool! although the beds were comfortable, my daughter and i were both victims of bed bugs during our stay. unfortunately we didn't know until the next day after we returned home. apparently bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to appear. my daughter and i both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our necks to our hips. the bites made you want to claw your skin off! my husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all. beware of room 3405 -- bed nearest the bathroom!!! i will not be fooled by a clean room again and will be checking under mattresses from now on....

"the room was very spacious with very nice, colorful decorating. the beds felt like lying on a cloud, and there were four pillows on each bed, two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better. the bathroom was very nice also. overall, i was very pleased with the stay. you had to show your room key to get in after ten p.m. i thought that was a good security issue. it has a great location too, close to downtown. i would recommend it. the decorations were very classy. most hotels have two of the same framed art, boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows. the hyatt regency was just the opposite.

"the room i booked a room here and was told i'd be getting a king bed. when i check in, they say they only have a queen bed room available. i protested to no avail. when i got to the room, it was really only a full size bed. so i went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in chicago. for the pleasure, i paid the same price as a normal king bed room. the full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable. i think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses. we would wake up with body aches and headaches. my wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights. not good. also, the internet in the room is hard to set-up, slow to use, and inconsistent. i generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work. the internet worked one day on my iphone and then would not log me in. it's not really worth it. room service room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical. some mornings they would take our towels (even the ones we hung up to use again) and not replace them, other times they would replace some towels and not others. they would also come at vastly different times. hotel service this hotel loves to nickel and dime. i asked for a fridge in the room and they told me it'd be $25. no other hotel i've ever stayed in (regardless of how many stars it had) has ever charged me for a fridge in the room. late checkout? charge. shuttle from the airport? - nonexistent. the front deck ""gold passport"" people can't even figure out how to get you points. in the end i will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay (not that i plan on staying at a hyatt property again). by the way, apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my mini-bar was missing. i was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying $25. the hotel the hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower. the west tower has some underground amenities no one uses. the bars are extremely expensive, but the drinks are tasty. the food is edible too, but i wouldn't brag about it. the hotel is not directly on the main street (michigan), but it's not too far from it. it's right next to the boat tours and, in some rooms, has a view of the navy pier. our room faced another hotel, but we could see a sliver of the pier. the hotel is walking distance from millennium park. it's a bit of a walk to any of the l stations though. if you want a wonderful breakfast place, go to wildberry on randolph st. it'll have you waiting to eat for a long time, but it's yummy! conclusion i get better rooms, better beds, better service, and better amenities at a holiday inn express or a best western. save the money and stay elsewhere.

"i stayed at the chicago fairmont for four nights for a conference. my fiance' accompanied me. when we checked in, we were given a room with two full size beds despite the fact that our reservation was for one king size bed. so instead of relaxing on the large luxurious bed we had imagined, we were forced to either sleep in separate beds like ward and june cleaver or either cuddle up on a small full size like two college kids in a fraternity house! we discovered that the coffee maker wasn't working and called down to the desk to have someone look at it, and waited two and half hours. we had issues with the plumbing, including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill. the toilet stopped working twice. we returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room, sitting on the bed, watching the tv and talking on her cell phone. they bellman were rude, and wouldn't let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment. there were errors on our bill. last but not least, we saw a roach in the drawers. alive. the restaurant downstairs was decent, and the location is fairly good since my conference was in the hyatt next door but for the price you can find someplace better. i will never ever stay here again under any circumstances.

"i booked this hotel with great expectations. i had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in chicago. upon arriving to the hotel (at the exact time i indicated in my reservation) i was told i've been ""downgraded"" to a lesser quality room. i travel very often and never had this before. moreover, i did not hear a single ""i'm sorry"", it was like usual business. what bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me ""i will decrease the rate for you"" ""what do you think, nice eh?"" like he was doing me a favor!!!! they decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course (which is the legal thing to do, since i am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money). they did not care that i wanted higher level room independent of value. i did not know what to say, since this never happened to me before, also with family present did not want to start arguing. the rooms were nice (not as nice as i thought) and location is good, however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this. that is enough for me not to go back again.

"i have stayed at the omni off an on over the years. on business, for personal trips. this trip started off quite rocky, and left me very un-impressed. 1) be aware, they have a new policy where they charge debit card $55 per day for ""incidentals"" which you *may* incur. they do this if you elect not to use a standard credit card. even if you have booked and paid for your room in advance. the desk clerk claimed ""all the hotels do this now""...funny how when i put a remote employee at the o'hare hilton on my business debit card, i was never asked for additional funds. having a policy is one thing, spreading blame for it is another. while not a problem for me, someone who plans trips down to the dollar and dime might encounter a problem with this ""policy"" of theirs. to my knowledge, they never did this sort of thing before. (i don't use credit cards, its why i have money in a recession. =)) 2) rooms were clean, but their in room accoutrements and mini bar items had no price list. the only thing labelled with a price was a bottle of water (about 600 ml) for $7.50. as such, be careful with the tray of goodies. if the water is $7.50, imagine what the snickers bar might cost. 3) our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken, and would not move. calling the front desk resulted in ... nothing. finally about 9:00 pm i elected to have another look at it, and it seemed to be off its track. i was able to successfully ""fix"" it, but the lack of response from maintenance, considering the rate for a suite, is sad. i remember this hotel being much more attentive and responsive. 4) the seem to cut a lot of corners on room stocking now. overall, i think i will be skipping the omni, and they will get no more of my business. it seems hilton treats people better overall. it's quite sad, as i have a lot of good memories with omni. i will not be back.

"this was the 2nd time that we have stayed at the hyatt regency chicago. the first time was far above our expectations for a $69/per night room. the rooms are very nice, and the beds are comfortable. this time we got a great rate through travelzoo @ $104/ night for a room with a view. we were aware of the $41 parking per night. the first night we got there the valet was yelling at us and said that we couldn't park they were full. we had no clue where to park at this point and had to drive around for over 45 minutes looking at closed parking garages. (it was a saturday evening) finally found a spot and were told that it would be $38. this was 6 blocks from the hotel. mind you its -6 outside and we have luggage to carry too. not very good service for a 5-star hotel. we got inside and apparently they were running a nightclub out of thier lobby, its called the harddrive. that's cool and all, yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room, it wasn't an issue. the hvac controls to our room were broken. the first night we were ok, but by the second night it was blazing hot in there, 86 degrees. so hot we couldn't sleep. it was miserable. they sent up the ""engineer"" and he determined that there was definately a problem and opened our window, 24 floors up. it never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night. it was 5 below that night and the window being open 8"" didn't help. they would not put us in another room either. at checkout, monday morning, our bill came to $240.43 after taxes for the room. we then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was billed on for $56.65. cool, i got my reciepts and went on our way. on wednesday i was on my online banking checking my account, to find that hyatt charged me $289.03 and another charge of $103.63!!! that is almost $100 more than what the reciepts from checkout say. i was furious, so i called the hotel. nothing was resolved by my phone call, they treated me as if $100 isn't but something you wipe with. she said give it another day or two and see if the additional authorization falls off. that didn't settle well with me, but what could i do. i waited. its friday now. i check on my account again and the charges cleared as they should have with the correct original amounts, and they still have ""authorizations"" on the two incorrect amounts as well. they have charged me an additional $300!!!!!! im so furious! and guess what... hyatt doesn't care. they gave me the same [--] line as they did wednesday. save yourself some hassle and don't stay at this hotel unless you have extra money for them to play with.

"outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. this hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! when i visited this hotel 14 years ago, the fairmont was among the classiest brands. no more. my 29th floor room was expansive, but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. the upholstery was frayed, the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water, and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. worse, the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you, with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. it was like sleeping in an old vending machine, but when i looked for a pen to take a phone message, there was none to be found. other reviewers remarked that this hotel ""needs updating,"" but i think some of the original design choices are also to blame. for instance, someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. i couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs.

"seriously overpriced the room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel. the ""amenities"" were a smoke screen, nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a holiday inn. i would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that i did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase. being charged $15/day for internet on top of a $250/night rate was a bit over the top. the bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient. the shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head, unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost. the staff were friendly and helpful, actually the best part of the stay were the staff. all in all i found it overpriced for the quality of the room.

"i haven't actually stayed at this hotel- yet- but am already disappointed in their customer service. i visit chicago quite often and usually stay at the intercontinental, but yesterday i read some online articles advertising the james hotel's ""cyber monday special"". the promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website, the hotel will match that amount in ""james credits"" that can be used toward your stay. none of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits. my next trip to chicago is in april, so i thought i'd give the james a try. i travel frequently with my pet and i've heard they have a very liberal pet-policy. so today i went online and bought a $500 certificate. me, having the one track mind that i do, somehow missed the part about the credits expiring march 31, 2010. i realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament. i said i couldn't be in chicago until april (i'm overseas on business until then), and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month, or it not, refund my gift certificate purchase. i had only just made the purchase minutes before and hadn't even recieved my email confirmation yet. most businesses offer a 24 hr grace period. the girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me- basically saying ""too bad, it's your problem now"". she didn't even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all. so now that i know this is the kind of service i can expect from the james, i might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel, or try hotel monaco. i hear they have great service and are good with pets too.

"months prior to my 5-night reservation with the hilton chicago i requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light, facing an open view, not a close building. (the reservation was made through a conference travel agency.) i confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check-in the clerk noted it in my record. she told me it would be difficult to find, but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me. i was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers, tucked into a very dark corner, facing a wall of rooms. i called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request, but to ""sit tight"" and someone would call me. no one did. further calls yielded similar results. at one point i was told i could have a ""parlor room,"" with a sofa bed, at a reduced rate, but i could not go see the room before committing to moving. that's real hospitality for you. worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave, i ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room. (i had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds.) the only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms. other than that, it was tight quarters with a tiny closet, two uncomfortably low chairs, at the desk and in a (dark) corner. light fixtures didn't do much to brighten things up. since i was here at a conference, i really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid-day calls and e-mail, but instead i got a cave. consequently, i spent as little time as possible in the room and next time i am in chicago, conference or not, i will absolutely stay at another hotel. there are much better locations that the hilton chicago and looking at the percentage of ""inside tower"" rooms, places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service. shame on the chicago hilton.

"my parents booked five nights at the james for its location and good reviews. they had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff. they sent engineers three times to repair the unit, and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn't, under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty. at my parents' request, the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort. the hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room. don't book this hotel in the summer. and by the way, there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings.

"we ate at the prime house restaurant last year, that is why we picked the hotel. last year the food and service at the prime house was outstanding. this year the service felt rushed. the waitress even asked why we were eating so early. it was 6:30pm. our room in the hotel felt cramped. the beds were comfortable. the bathroom had maintenance problems. the maid service and turndown out night was good. all of the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. i just was not impressed by the quality of the hotel itself for what we were paying.

"i recently returned from a trip to chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby. while the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers. when we arrived it took over an hour to check in. we had requested two rooms on the same floor, which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival. when we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it. eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there. we also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers. when we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in. we also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping. we filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests. after complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate. this ""something"" never arrived. we will not be making a return visit to this hotel. while the housekeeping staff, location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative.

"first, several day s prior to my stay, i called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service saturday and sunday. saturday they didn't bring breakfast - and when i called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge. when they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing.. and then brought the wrong order again on sunday. i was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service saturday night. the food was limp and uninspired. further, i ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon. when i called in-room dining to request a spoon, i was told one would be forthcoming. 15 minutes later, a waiter arrived with a menu. when i explained i already had food and i didn't need a menu - i needed a spoon, he had the audacity to argue with me. i respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so. another 15 minutes (and one bowl of cold soup) later i decided to call in-room dining back to request (again) they send someone with a spoon. they too argued with me and expressed that they'd already sent someone with a spoon. i explained that they had not - that i had received a menu i didn't request, but that no spoon was forthcoming. another 15 minutes later, a spoon finally arrived. thanks - for charging me $100+ so that i could argue over cold, flavorless food. in addition to the gross customer service, surly attitude, and sorry food, i found the room woefully lacking. it reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on saturday night i woke up from the smell. further, i had specifically requested when i booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators... i was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went.

"elegant lobby, comfy beds, nice sheets but, we were given a (not fancy, a little dated) room on the 5th floor which had a view of the monstrous venting structure, and was located off the lobby so we heard the elevator all night. at the hilton, one is charged for internet access on each device per hour. (we stayed in the middle of ohio and received total access for free.) we didn't drink the $6.00 water or try the $28. breakfast buffet. the staff was friendly, but of course you tip for a smile. they did give us a cot for free as we had asked for a room with a fold-out couch as we were a party of 5. didn't use the gym or pool on the 8th floor, but looked nice (small pool.) no view of the water possible, though we were right at grant park. we tried to view the fireworks from a higher story, no such luck. ...read more

"i expected a glamorous room and i walked into a disappointment. housekeeping and management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel. if you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms doesn't go down past 74, the closet is 24"" wide, all old/dirty brass fixtures, beds that are a little bigger than a twin, showerheads that barely put out water, then this is your hotel. i might be spoiled by staying in marriott's, but i stay in hotels 1/3 of the year and was severly disappionted. no free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again.

"while overall a decent property, the incident i had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel. i recently stayed at the hotel monaco for five nights, checking out on monday, march 19th. shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet, my partner and i noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasn't present upon checking in. we had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay. i called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at park one (their valet company) who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival, and was scraped upon departure from the garage. the garage manager, mike yunan, didn't call back until i had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel, marco scherer. when he finally got back to me, the garage manager stated that he would file an ""incident report"" and claim with his insurance company, travelers, which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldn't admit fault or liability, nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage, which could have verified that the damage wasn't present upon check-in, but was at check-out. their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location, contradicting the garage manager. in the end, this kimpton intouch guest got stuck with a $1,000 bill for parking at this kimpton property: an almost $500 paint scrape on top of a $48/per day parking fee, rental car expenses, several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue, and one gigantic headache. in the end, do not trust the valets or staff at this hotel, and take your business elsewhere if at all possible.

"a lovely hotel in a trendy part of chicago which gives it a much more comfortable feel than the downtown hotels. the rooms are very, very well appointed, but not large, and the quality of the materials is wonderful without exception. unfortunately, the service was below average in every way: they failed to deliver laundry by an important and assured deadline; valets didn't deliver the car and had to be asked twice; the concierge gave us miserable directions that got us lost, and the front desk was unable to rectify any issue. it amazed me that so much incompetence could happen in 6 hours! and even after recognizing their shortcomings, not one sincere or significant apology. a poster child of how bad service cannot overcome a well-built, well-furnished hotel.

"my first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. for some reason, i kept being disappointed at every turn. noisy room on the 4th floor. could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. be warned - no water, no mini-bar no vending machine, no nothing once you get in your room. you might as well be in prison. they have coffee in the morning, but it starts at 6 so i had to wait both days. i guess that is convenient for them, but what about me? workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. the only treadmill i could get on was broken. guess what a cooler with water in it! oh no - it was only stocked for one day. after that nothing. way to set expectations and then fail to deliver. same with towels - one day they have them - next day they don't. they essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $10 charge for wireless (go a few doors down to starbucks where it is free). they should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. i have stayed at much better for less. won't be coming back.

"i stayed at the chicago hilton because it was host to a conference i was attending. before i arrived i tried to find out about the ""in room fitness"" program advertised on the corporate website. i called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center. i explained that i was inquiring about the 'in room fitness' advertised on their website. she put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that i should call the property directly. i did and got the same response. i asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room. again, this was a problem. when i arrived at the hotel, no treadmill was available. when i went to tour the fitness room the first night i found that they close at 9pm. when i returned to the center the next day i discovered that they charge $13 per day to use the fitness equipment. the pool, track and locker room are free, but to use the treadmills, etc. you have to pay $13 per day. this charge is not noted anywhere -- not on the website, not in any of the guest service materials in the room. the food for the conference was mediocre, but the one room service meal i had was pretty good. during one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldn't hear the speaker. the hvac didn't work well in my room and i kept the windows open for most of my three night stay. the beds were comfortable with very nice linens. i tried to get a late checkout, which was offered on a card in my room. the woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour, not the 11-2pm range advertised in my room. the best service i received was from the folks in the security office. the hotel does not have safes in guest rooms, so i became very friendly with security office as i locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time i couldn't carry it out of the hotel. i visit chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the marriott properties. only wish i had done so for this visit.

"we got a spanking deal at this hotel for $99 a night. it's in a good location to the loop. excellent transportation options abound. my gripe comes from the fact that we were obviously put in a ""crappy"" room. it overlooked the back of the building and the roof of a building next to us. the toilet in the room was not bolted to the floor. other than that, if i needed to stay in the loop again for something and i knew i wasn't going to be put in a undesirable room, i would stay here again.

"i stayed at the hilton chicago last week and was very disappointed. the highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage. finally, my 72 year old mother, 8 year old son, and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves - no easy task. the security guard was kind enough to hold the door for me. the valet parking attendants looked over and then ignored us. as far as i could tell, he was just standing there doing nothing. i couldn't let go of the bags without everything falling so i gave my son the parking receipt. the attendant pointed to where our car was parked - no short distance away. my 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up. they should have been ashamed. less significant, but irritating issues. the pool is part of the hilton athletic club. two lanes are reserved for adults wanting to lap swim. basically, two adults can take up 2/3rds of the pool while everyone else is consigned to the leftover 1/3rd. this is ridiculous and very family unfriendly. in addition, the pool closes at 9 p.m. what pool closes at 9? we stayed for 3 nights. not one single additional bar of soap, bottle of shampoo, or coffee stirrers.

"first let me say, the front office people at hotel monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what i'd hoped. there are some other problems; the furnishings are quite rundown, and housekeeping wasn't very helpful. we booked a suite and the sofa bed, chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use. i've attached pictures, so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows. comfortable it was not! the chair bottom is all broken down too. i invited one of the assistant managers to view our furniture, and a slight adjustment was made in our rate. as to housekeeping, we had ordered an in-room coffee service (which kimpton's web site says is there, but you have to specifically request) and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee. we had to call the front desk every day. and, housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl. i had requested water be added to the bowl when i noticed it going down and my note was disregarded. these things may not matter to you, but if you plan to spend a week, like we did, you might want to be comfortable. the bedroom and bathroom were superior; just the living room was bad.

"i had my wedding ceremony and reception at the sofitel. it seems as though i had the same experience as ""judy l."" i read her review and thought ""that's exactly what happened to me!"" here's what happened: the good news: the actual event was great. most notably, the food was absolutely incredible; i think almost every one of our guests has raved to us about the food. the same goes for the cake, which was made by take the cake. the service by the waiters and other staff was also very good. the bad news: michelle, the director of catering, honestly made my wedding planning process a nightmare. while we were negotiating the contract, she promptly responded to my emails and phone calls; after the contract was signed, it was a constant struggle to get in touch with her to get my questions answered, to schedule the tasting, etc. she frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email, and she occasionally never returned my email or phone call until i called her a second or third time. i assumed things would get better within the month--or even the week--prior to my wedding, but they actually got even worse. michelle just could not get it together, and if it weren't for my wedding coordinator's assistance in forcing her to finally get things right, i don't know what would have happened. thus, if it weren't for michelle's inability to do her job, i would have had a great experience. but, as it is, when i think back about my experience with the sofitel, i unfortunately have very negative thoughts. and that's incredibly disappointing, considering it was a major part of the best night of my life.

"we stayed at hotel monaco and upgraded to a suite. i was disappointed with the room layout, and shabby furniture. i bumped into the coffee table and the top almost crashed to the ground. the make up mirror in the bathroom didnt work, the tv reception was very poor and overall the room just wasnt worth the $450 we spent there. next time, we will go back to trump tower across the street, which is far superior to hotel monaco.

"this was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby. however, when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy. our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty. wireless internet is available, but that's an additional fee. are you kidding? even the roach motel offers wireless for free! also, the fitness room was available for only $15 per day. wow, i thought the room rate was enough to cover that. when i used the coffee supplies in the room, they were not replenished. i called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasn't housekeeping's area but they would send some up. no kidding, nearly 90 minutes later i got the cream and sugar! glad i wasn't in a big hurry. i'll definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time i'm in chicago!

"my husband and i were there for a conference and had booked the room thru their website, when called to confirm had us down for only 1 night instead of 4, easily changed. first morning cold,cold shower, didn't complain,next day fine. phone did not work, called every day to complain, and every day said it would be fixed when got back to room, never was. no dial tone, unable to call restaurant, or call for car or call for room service. finally, on last night someone came to our room while we were there and did fix it. the hotel is beautiful, rooms great and everyone was so nice, even when i was complaining they were nice. great gym area also, and love the restaurant. but, for the money i could easily find another hotel just as nice with a working phone.

"if you love brick walls and alleyways, then this view is for you. i asked for a room facing the river, i get a room facing a brick wall. that really pissed me off. from all the great reviews, i was expecting better. before i came here, i stayed in a hyatt in nyc, and that was awesome. there was nothing about the hotel that blew me away. the wine hour was ok. i was hoping there would be something better food, but i guess that's why it's a wine hour. i ordered room service one night. there wasn't really anywhere to eat it, so i had to eat it on my bed to watch tv. this was my first time coming to chicago, and i think it will be my last. just thoroughly disappointed.

"the hotel definitely doesn't match its 4.5 rating. the receptionist was very unhelpful and dishonest, and i don't feel welcome at all. i booked a non-smoking room, but upon arrival, the receptionist told me that there was no non-smoking room left. of course he was lying. i argued with him for 5 minutes, before he reluctantly gave me a non-smoking room. at checkout, they tried to charge me $40 upgrade fee each day, because i requested a non-smoking room. this was completely ridiculous. i had to go argue with the receptionist again before they agreed to take away the charges. the room was quite small, the tv was broken, so i had to call someone to fix the tv. then the wireless network banned my ip address, so i had to talk to their tech-support -- the tech support was quite friendly, knowledgeable and helpful -- i guess this was the only bright point of the stay.

"it's not a bad hotel. it's just so...disappointing. as a diamond member, i expect slightly more than a room with two double beds with no view. i'm not distraught over this, but come on. ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge, which has nothing but fattening pastries, bagels and cereal. low-level hampton inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame. and what's with the lounge not opening until 6:30am? business travelers often need to be gone by 6:30, not sitting down to their meager breakfast. the in-room wifi is a pain to access, and i somehow got stuck with the $19.99 plan even though i selected the basic plan. (don't get me started on how a $89/night hampton inn can offer free wifi and a full-service hilton & towers seemingly can't...). finally, what's with the two bathrooms per one hotel room? it's an unseemly waste of space, especially when the rooms are so meager. and the gold-plated bathroom fixtures scream 1992, not 2009, as does the picture-tube tv (vs. flat panel). overall, this is a huge disappointment over which conrad should be ashamed.

"my wife and i brought our daughter downtown for a blowout ""american girl"" weekend and chose the monaco because of it's glowing reviews. we arrived late and maybe that's when they put out their second-stringers, but we felt unwelcome by the desk staff--like we were an intrusion. i'll never understand this--they're in the hospitality business and they're inhospitable! (this is getting picky, but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage louis vuitton trunk needs some maintenance. the repeated ""hm"" initials are peeling off--looks like they used rub-downs where they should have silk screened for durability). when we got to our room we found the maid's ratty work shoes at the foot of the bed (yuck!). i'm still trying to figure out that scenario. there were no ashes--so i've ruled out spontaneous combustion. also, to the disappointment of my daughter, the much-advertised goldfish was mia. the bellhop (who apologized for the shoes) explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed ""...is that ok?"" he said. i think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking 35c/ fish to make a tired 5-year-old happy. on the up side, the rooms are nice and have an over-the-top decoration that my daughter loved (""i'd like to live here!"" she said). the bed is very comfortable--my wife wants the same brand now. the bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong shower--except for the cheap fall-apart-while-you're-using-it toilet paper. come on kimpton! how much can a decent roll cost? the view towards the river is great (try to get one) and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the window--she closed the curtains and was in her own ""club house"" watching the world go by from from high above the city. in short: very nice hotel--desk staff at night could be nicer (wouldn't cost anything and would have made up for the maid's shoes!)

"had a week long stay at the hilton on south michigan while attending a meeting. the hotel has some elegance in the lobby, meeting rooms and lounges - the hotel rooms could definitely use updating. i would definitely say that for the price of a room here - the rooms should be top notch. my car was misplaced during valet parking, our reservations were messed up, hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items (room service, a new coffee pot, laundry) that wasn't ours. i would not stay at this property again. there are much better places for the money in close proximity to michigan ave. it is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at faulty towers.

"we stayed at the james hotel for a 40th birthday. the location was excellent for shopping and restaurants, but also very loud. the room was horrible. very small. we had a double/double and it was the size of a college dorm room, plus completely white walls and linens. absolutely no color except for one accent pillow. it was very sterile and uninviting. we were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting. it looked like the entrance to hell, if not a haunted house. staff was very nice and accomodating. i would not return to this hotel.

"i stayed at the hotel during the dave matthews caravan tour and would come home each night rather dusty/dirty from being at an outdoor concert with 200,000 of my closest friends. i used half a bottle of shampoo the first night. the second night, the staff had not refreshed my bar soap or shampoo. i informed the front desk who made apologies and said they would take care of it immediately. i got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap (hand soap) for the bath/shower and they had replaced the shampoo in its original place, nicely displayed, but with the exact same bottle of shampoo that was now 1/8 full. yeah!! the hotel is in a great location to navy pier and michigan ave....i'll grant them that....but that's where their ""pros"" end. i'd rather stay at a hampton inn. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
